ajax;20060520 17:40:15;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:A new OCW tool is designed tightly coupled with eduCommons to support OpenCourseWare. We will discuss the technical features of the tool, and demonstrate how this tool could help ease the conversion from active course site into OCW copy, hence increase the scalability of OCW practice.
ajax;20060520 17:40:15;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:OpenCourseWare, which has been initiated by MIT, has become a worldwide event. However the high cost of conversion hideres its adoption among many other universities. 

In order to help automating the process of OCW migration and reducing the cost, the new OCW tool in sakai helps to generate a large number of open educational objects as quickly and easily as possible, manage the use of metadata across the system, and exports course materials with IMS CP format. eduCommons tool then uses workflow tool to help finally publish the course.
