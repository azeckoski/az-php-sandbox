ajax;20060825 13:37:14;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Is the technical jargon making your head spin?  What question sounds more interesting to you:  1) What database configuration should I use for Sakai 2.2.1?  Or, 2) Why should I use Melete to organize content?  If you answered #2, please attend this interactive workshop for Instructional Designers.  
ajax;20060825 13:37:14;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:For this presentation, Iâ€™m proposing the Discussion/Roundtable format.  I will start with a brief demonstration and the rest of the time will be for Instructional Designers to share best practices.

I attended the conference in Austin and Vancouver.  As an Instructional Designer, I often thought the conference lacked practical information about using Sakai as a teaching and learning instrument.  This presentation is a direct result of wanting more practical examples of how to work with instructors to establish courses in Sakai, especially when all the tools are not necessarily working correctly.  For example, should an instructor use Melete, or simply put their materials in the class Resources area?  How can I organize my tool menu so the Message Center is at the top of the list?  Is there any research that correlates learning with the use of a graphic interface such as the one used by R-Smart?
