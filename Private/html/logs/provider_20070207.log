ajax;20070207 10:23:07;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The ResourceTypeRegistry is new in Sakai 2.4.  It allows webapps to define new types of resources that will appear in the Resources tool. A type registration can customize the way in which resources are created and revised. Also, it can define custom actions. In Sakai 2.4, the registry is used to define OSP Form Items and Sakaibrary Citation Lists. This workshop is aimed at developers who might want to use the registry to customize the way the Resources tool deals with entities relevant to other Sakai tools or services.
