ajax;20061019 06:07:17;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:The Sakai project and the community that developed around it, is the most exciting phenomenon in (higher) education in the past two decades.

Having been involved in higher education for many years (as a student, researcher, academic, teaching media specialist, techie and senior ICT manager), I have acquired a sound knowledge of the functionalities, interdependencies and politics of the sector and may contribute towards the general success of the Board.   I would, however, like to highlight two areas where I might add unique value:

Firstly - Sakai, under the guidance of the Foundation, has the potential of becoming a truly global resource.  Unfortunately countries that need these resources the most are not part of the Sakai community, even though they represent the majority of the global population.  Africa (South Africa) and other developing countries are far removed from 1st world countries geopolitically, socioeconomically and technically.  In these countries the digital divide is a stark reality.  Having a representative on the Sakai Foundation Board who understands these unique challenges may greatly enhance the possibilities for the adoption of Sakai in developing countries where OSS has the potential to make a real difference. 
  
Secondly - Most institutions involved in the Sakai initiatives are residential face-to-face institutions where Sakai is used as a tool to augment classroom sessions.  More and more people worldwide are using distance education as their primary means of education. I have been the primary driver for the use of technology in two major open and distance learning (ODL) institutions over the past 15+ years.  Sharing my experience may contribute towards the success of Sakai in an ever changing education landscape.

Although my involvement in the international community has been somewhat limited, I have been very active in promoting Sakai and building the Sakai community locally.  Under my leadership, Unisa has deployed ”myUnisa”, one of the largest enterprise installs of Sakai (118 000+ students) within 7 months.   We have established “Sakai South Africa” and although it is currently quite small, it will grow steadily.  My awareness campaigns among ICT practitioners at South African Universities have made Sakai a point of conversation among senior ICT practitioners at all the major universities in South Africa (as well as in many curriculum and courseware development departments).  Senior members of many national collaborative bodies such NADEOSA, DEASA, SAIDE, COL,  FOTIM and the South African IT Directors Forum, have been made aware of the potential of Sakai to contribute towards the success of open education initiatives in Southern African (and Africa).   

I believe that the commitment, dedication and passion of the Sakai Community have the potential to redefine online education globally.  I feel privileged to be part of such a community and hope that my contribution will make a difference.

He joined Technikon SA (TSA), a distance mode vocational training institution, as a lecturer in 1990 and among others establishing a multipurpose sciences laboratory and a multimedia production unit.

In 1993 Deon decided to change his career to work full time on ICT.  He was offered a systems analyst/programming position at TSA’s IT department in 1995.  Deon established TSA’s web presence and was soon promoted to Internet Manager.  He created and led a specialist team with the responsibility of deploying TSA on the Internet and developing a fully integrated home –grown Virtual Campus (first of its kind in Africa).

Deon established the Integrated Technology Centre (ITC) in 1998.  The ITC was an income generating multifunctional, multidisciplinary technology centre, specialising in the development and deployment of tailored solutions for education.

In 2002 the ITC merged with the Directorate: ICT where he served as Director: Applications and Solutions development and was responsible for three domains; Business Analysis, all institutional systems development and Online & Multimedia development and deployment.

In January 2004 TSA merged with Unisa and Vista-Vudec to form a new comprehensive, open learning and distance education institution.  Deon was a member of the Inter-institutional Task Team (IITT) responsible for ICT matters.  The new Unisa serves more than 250 000 students and is classed as a mega university in global terms.

Currently Deon is responsible for portal and academic solutions (including the Virtual Campus).  The Virtual Campus currently serves more than 118 000 registered online students.  He is part of various senior institutional forums and is co-author of Unisa’s Technology Model.

Deon has written several publications, has presented papers and workshops at numerous national and international conferences and has served on various inter-institutional forums and committees.

ajax;20061019 09:59:11;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:If elected to the Sakai Board of Directors, I would strongly advocate for three issues. First, I would like to see renewed and redoubled efforts to strengthen Sakai as a flexible framework that can act as a platform for accelerated innovation and high-quality user experience. Clearly, Sakai has been a pioneer in this regard and has made significant strides, particularly in the most recent releases. Equally clearly, there is much more work that could be done. Chuck Severence’s recent position paper on the Sakai Object Bus, Oracle’s AEI initiative, and the Bodington Tetra collaboration are three great examples of what could be done next. As a member of the Board, I would work hard to find additional resources and support for these efforts, always with the goal of gaining a net acceleration in the community’s ability to respond nimbly to evolving member needs for the platform.

Second, I would look to expand inter-institutional collaboration among end users of the Sakai platform, with a goal of getting better information to improve the quality of the capabilities and user experience. Currently, Sakai benefits tremendously from the cross-fertilization that happens between development teams in different institutions. There is no reason why the community could not accrue equally remarkable benefits from strong cross-fertilization among teachers, administrators, and students who can help define and refine requirements for the platform. Also, speaking as a non-technologist educator, it has been my personal experience that educators can be much more helpful to technologists and usability engineers when they are invited into the conversation and are educated on how the software development process works. Not all faculty are interested in this sort of a dialog; however, even if one percent of the faculty at the participating universities were to engage, I believe Sakai would reap enormous benefits. As a Board member, I would like to help design an outreach program that would make the Sakai community an attractive place for educators interested in the quality of their virtual learning environments.

And finally, as somebody who has been outspoken on the edupatent issue, I would like to see Sakai take a leadership role within the broader educational community in defining sensible intellectual property policies for higher education. The Sakai community has among its members some of the most prolific and sophisticated producers of intellectual property in the academe. In addition, the project itself has a history of innovation in this regard via its community source approach. Sakai and its membership are uniquely positioned to see all sides of the patent dilemma and to help their peer institutions articulate a coherent and pragmatic approach to a problem that is looming larger for both Open Source and higher education by the day. As a Board member, I could act as a conduit between the considerable expertise within the Sakai community and the equally considerable expertise that is rallying to this cause elsewhere within the higher education ecosphere.

ajax;20061019 16:04:15;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:We present an alternative approach to traditional requirements based system design called Capabilities Engineering, which mathematically exploits the structural semantics of the Function Decomposition graph — a representation of user needs — to formulate Capabilities. For any given software system, the set of derived Capabilities embodies change-tolerant characteristics. The Capability set is chosen to accommodate an incremental development approach, and to reflect the constraints of technology feasibility and implementation schedules.
For the purposes of validation we choose to analyze SAKAI because it exhibits characteristics associated with complex emergent systems. Unlike typical systems, SAKAI is well-documented and has a comprehensive change-history.  These features assist the statistical examination of the Capabilities-based approach for developing change-tolerant systems.

ajax;20061019 16:04:15;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Complex emergent systems need to be change-tolerant, as they have lengthy development cycles. Requirements and technology often evolve during such development periods, and thereby, inhibit a comprehensive up-front solution specification. Failing to accommodate changed requirements or to incorporate latest technology results in an unsatisfactory system, and thereby, invalidates the huge investments of time and money. Recent history of system failures provides ample evidence to support this fact. We propose an alternative approach of development termed Capabilities Engineering (CE) to develop change-tolerant systems. It is a scientific, disciplined and deliberate process for defining Capabilities as functional   abstractions, which are the building blocks of the system. Capabilities are designed to exhibit high cohesion and low coupling, which are also desirable from a software engineering perspective, to promote change-tolerance. In addition, the CE process touts a multi-disciplinary optimization approach for selecting an optimal set of Capabilities that accommodates the constraints of technology advancement and development schedule.
 
We choose to validate our research using SAKAI, which displays the characteristics of a complex emergent system. In particular, SAKAI is being incrementally developed and is expected to have an extended lifetime. Furthermore, the inherent complexity of SAKAI as a software system is  compounded by the need to coordinate global development efforts.  We capture the functionality of  SAKAI in a Function Decomposition (FD) graph. The FD graph illustrates user needs in terms of desired functionalities and captures their associated levels of abstraction. From this graph we determine slices — sets of nodes that can be considered as Capabilities — and compute their cohesion and coupling values. We then identify an optimal set based on scheduling needs, balanced abstraction levels and technology constraints. We utilize the change history associated with SAKAI and perform impact analysis to determine if the set of Capabilities suggested by CE is more change-tolerant than the existing implementation. CE is a recursive process of selection, optimization, reorganization and hence, the stabilization of Capabilities. We envision that the Capabilities based approach provides a high-level development framework, for complex emergent systems, accommodating change and facilitating evolution with minimal impact.

ajax;20061019 21:08:26;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:We present an alternative approach to traditional requirements based system design called Capabilities Engineering, which mathematically exploits the structural semantics of the Function Decomposition graph — a representation of user needs — to formulate Capabilities. For any given software system, the set of derived Capabilities embodies change-tolerant characteristics. The Capability set is chosen to accommodate an incremental development approach, and to reflect the constraints of technology feasibility and implementation schedules.
For the purposes of validation we choose to analyze SAKAI because it exhibits characteristics associated with complex emergent systems. Unlike typical systems, SAKAI is well-documented and has a comprehensive change-history.  These features assist the statistical examination of the Capabilities-based approach for developing change-tolerant systems.

ajax;20061019 21:08:26;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Complex emergent systems need to be change-tolerant, as they have lengthy development cycles. Requirements and technology often evolve during such development periods, and thereby, inhibit a comprehensive up-front solution specification. Failing to accommodate changed requirements or to incorporate latest technology results in an unsatisfactory system, and thereby, invalidates the huge investments of time and money. Recent history of system failures provides ample evidence to support this fact. We propose an alternative approach of development termed Capabilities Engineering (CE) to develop change-tolerant systems. It is a scientific, disciplined and deliberate process for defining Capabilities as functional   abstractions, which are the building blocks of the system. Capabilities are designed to exhibit high cohesion and low coupling, which are also desirable from a software engineering perspective, to promote change-tolerance. In addition, the CE process touts a multi-disciplinary optimization approach for selecting an optimal set of Capabilities that accommodates the constraints of technology advancement and development schedule.
 
We choose to validate our research using SAKAI, which displays the characteristics of a complex emergent system. In particular, SAKAI is being incrementally developed and is expected to have an extended lifetime. Furthermore, the inherent complexity of SAKAI as a software system is  compounded by the need to coordinate global development efforts.  We capture the functionality of  SAKAI in a Function Decomposition (FD) graph. The FD graph illustrates user needs in terms of desired functionalities and captures their associated levels of abstraction. From this graph we determine slices — sets of nodes that can be considered as Capabilities — and compute their cohesion and coupling values. We then identify an optimal set based on scheduling needs, balanced abstraction levels and technology constraints. We utilize the change history associated with SAKAI and perform impact analysis to determine if the set of Capabilities suggested by CE is more change-tolerant than the existing implementation. CE is a recursive process of selection, optimization, reorganization and hence, the stabilization of Capabilities. We envision that the Capabilities based approach provides a high-level development framework, for complex emergent systems, accommodating change and facilitating evolution with minimal impact.
