ajax;20061001 01:51:18;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The Sakaibrary Project has implemented the OKI Repository OSID to interface commercial metasearch engines with Sakaibrary's re-purposed version of the "Twin Peaks" Repository OSID searching tool.  How does this work lend itself to existing and future ideas of Repository OSID use within Sakai?
ajax;20061001 01:51:18;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The goals of this session are to:
* gather leaders working with (or with an interest in) Sakai and the Repository OSID.
* share a summary of the Sakaibrary Project's work implementing the Repository OSID and re-purposing "Twin Peaks" with the Sakai & Repository OSID community to lower barriers to interoperability.
* share existing and future ideas of Repository OSID use within Sakai (this will start with the panel and then be open to the audience).
* discuss possibilities for interoperability between ideas.

In the previous Sakai Conference, there was a rather large BOF and much e-mail discussion on the topic of Repositories in general in Sakai and the intersection of the Repository OSID.  This session would act as a follow-up to that BOF/discussion, highlighting the Sakaibrary Project's work accessing "repositories" (metasearch engines) in Sakai through use of the Repository OSID.

ajax;20061001 17:10:59;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Many businesses, higher education institutions and government organizations in the US, Canada, and the EU are facing what is called a “knowledge transfer crisis” - the approaching retirement age of millions from the baby boomer generation means these organizations risk losing a critical mass of their leadership and institutional knowledge in coming years.  This interactive session will address how knowledge transfer issues can be addressed through integrative portfolio-based learning and potentially, ePortfolio tools . The session will include an overview of definitions and concepts related to knowledge transfer, and an interactive exercise wherein participants will learn a few basic steps involved in retrieving tacit (unconscious) forms of knowledge both within themselves and others.  There will also be a discussion of the potential ways ePortfolio tools could be used to support various types of organizations in identifying and addressing knowledge transfer needs.

ajax;20061001 17:46:10;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Since successful presentations at Vancouver, RSF has moved on to cover virtually all of the use cases required for a comprehensive web framework. Billed as becoming the "PHP of Sakai" on grounds of its comparative ease of use relative to other Java frameworks, RSF nonetheless emphasises correctness and minimality in programming, encouraging designs that are easy to understand, test and maintain. This session will focus in depth on the use of RSF's EL system to provide guaranteed execution of code within the request (typically used for Validation), as well as explaining the RSF treatment of scope, essential to understand interaction with external sources of state, such as databases, Sessions and in particular Sakai Helpers.

ajax;20061001 18:15:23;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The most long-awaited feature of RSF, "Multi-file Templates", is now ready. MFT, which on the Java side is implemented in terms of RSF "Evolvers", allows UI designers and developers to develop reusable "components" (or "widgets") by building libraries of plain HTML, rather than opaque "taglibs" or other unholy mixtures of presentation and content. This session will cover the new system, and show how easily new components can be developed in RSF, or assimilated from other (client-side) frameworks.
ajax;20061001 18:15:23;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:MFT and Evolvers promise to break the long-term deadlock within Sakai UI between the requirements and demands of the UI team, and the near-impossibility of satisfying them with current view technologies. This session will show that by "reorganising" the functionality traditionally entangled in the "conceptual heap" that is taglibs, into three completely separate worlds, that of HTML for designers, pure POJOs for developers, and a lightweight "Evolver" structure at the interface (which may be represented in XML as well as Java), the separate teams can begin to be freed to work independently yet interactively, rather than remain at loggerheads.
