Since that time, the biggest hurdle has been getting academics on board. Therefore, the myUnisa team includes technical support and learning design support from various departments.

This paper reports on how SAKAI tools can be integrated into a blended approach to learning at Unisa. They will also give some insight into how support staff help academics in a paper-based distance learning experience to enhance teaching and learning with all available educational technologies.

Distance learning is increasingly the preferred mode of learning for many learners. There is an appreciation among prospective learners, especially working adults with families, for the greater flexibility and the fewer time constraints that distance learning offers. 

The challenge is to develop distance learning programmes that: 
• Are offered in a blended mode
• Provide an interactive and more pleasant learning experience 
• Encourage self-directed explorative knowledge formation.

My activities and advocacy as a member of the Sakai board of directors would be based on three important principles. First, the long-term success of the Sakai project depends upon the effectiveness of local implementations. The quality of the software product is, of course, an essential component to this. Over time the other aspects of effective implementation –teaching methods, support infrastructure, rollout processes, etcetera—will become increasingly important. Ultimately, we must remember that institutions across the world have alternatives to Sakai and the costs of a software product go well beyond license fees. As a member of the Board I would work to ensure that the value provided by Sakai--as a product and as a community--is superior.

Which leads directly to the second principle: The long-term success of Sakai depends on a strong and diverse community of practice. This diversity should be found in the types of institutions, their geographic location, their size, their relative wealth and the way they use Sakai. The voices of the broad community (including those not using Sakai today) need to be heard and prioritized. It is important that members of the Board be able to distance themselves from their particular experiences when evaluating this information. As a member of the Board I will work to ensure that we have processes for gathering, using and disseminating this information.

The final principle is a bit mundane, I’m afraid: Resources matter. As a member of the Board I will work to increase the funding for Sakai and ensure that the existing resources are utilized efficiently so we can get more done.

As I am not a representative of a member institution, my candidacy may seem a bit unusual. Hopefully my personal biography sufficiently highlights my interest in Sakai. I have had an extremely broad set of experiences in technology-based learning. I’ve worked as a research staff member, a software engineer, an instructional designer, a graduate teaching assistant, a consultant, a manager and an operations executive. I’m a skilled listener, an excellent communicator and can make strategic decisions. My usefulness to the community is the critical issue. Part of this value will come from my particular skills and experiences. The rest will come from the fact that, as someone not currently working in higher education, I will bring a diverse perspective to the board; a perspective that is not influenced by a particular institution’s experience with Sakai.

I have been working in the field of education and technology since 1987, when I became involved in a combined research/teaching project at Stanford, under the direction of Professor Larry Friedlander in the English Department. This project looked at the possibilities of the application of interactive video technology to teaching Shakespeare. The project eventually won an award from Apple Computer and led to further projects at Apple’s Multimedia Lab. 

Since these early experiences I have dedicated my career to the intersection of technology and learning and to the relationship between academia and the corporate world. From the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern (as both research staff member and graduate student) to a variety of commercial environments, I remain as interested and eager as I was when I started, 18 years ago. 
      
I currently work as Vice President of Operations at ELT, a leading provider of online harassment and discrimination training. We work with over 500 organizations of all types, including colleges and universities. Among other things, I’m responsible for a Learning Management System containing nearly 500,000 users that delivers 20 thousand courses monthly.

Previously, I was with DigitalThink, one of the leading developers of custom e-learning content. I started at DigitalThink as Managing Director of Learning Strategy and later worked in Product Management. Prior to that I worked as Vice President of eLearning Solutions at Cognitive Arts, a company that grew from the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern. In addition to numerous corporate clients, we worked with Harvard Business School Publishing, INSEAD and Columbia University.

I have followed the mission and goals of the Sakai project since its inception and believe it can and will be successful in delivering an infrastructure that improves learning, teaching and research. I have been awaiting the right opportunity to contribute again to the world of higher education. I would be thrilled to be able to be part of Sakai.

I started at DigitalThink as Managing Director of Learning Strategy and later worked in Product Management.

I have followed the mission and goals of the Sakai project since its inception and believe it can and will be successful in delivering an infrastructure that improves learning, teaching and research. I have been awaiting the right opportunity to contribute again to the world of higher education. I would be thrilled to be able to be part of Sakai.

ajax;20061020 13:21:36;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:My activities and advocacy as a member of the Sakai board of directors would be based on three important principles. First, the long-term success of the Sakai project depends upon the effectiveness of local implementations. The quality of the software product is, of course, an essential component to this. Over time the other aspects of effective implementation –teaching methods, support infrastructure, rollout processes, etcetera—will become increasingly important. Ultimately, we must remember that institutions across the world have alternatives to Sakai and the costs of a software product go well beyond license fees. As a member of the Board I would work to ensure that the value provided by Sakai--as a product and as a community--is superior.

Which leads directly to the second principle: The long-term success of Sakai depends on a strong and diverse community of practice. This diversity should be found in the types of institutions, their geographic location, their size, their relative wealth and the way they use Sakai. The voices of the broad community (including those not using Sakai today) need to be heard and prioritized. It is important that members of the Board be able to distance themselves from their particular experiences when evaluating this information. As a member of the Board I will work to ensure that we have processes for gathering, using and disseminating this information.

The final principle is a bit mundane, I’m afraid: Resources matter. As a member of the Board I will work to increase the funding for Sakai and ensure that the existing resources are utilized efficiently so we can get more done.

As I am not a representative of a member institution, my candidacy may seem a bit unusual. Hopefully my personal biography sufficiently highlights my interest in Sakai. I have had an extremely broad set of experiences in technology-based learning. I’ve worked as a research staff member, a software engineer, an instructional designer, a graduate teaching assistant, a consultant, a manager and an operations executive. I’m a skilled listener, an excellent communicator and can make strategic decisions. My usefulness to the community is the critical issue. Part of this value will come from my particular skills and experiences. The rest will come from the fact that, as someone not currently working in higher education, I will bring a diverse perspective to the board; a perspective that is not influenced by a particular institution’s experience with Sakai.

ajax;20061020 15:54:36;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:Dear Sakai community,

Stanford joined in the Sakai project because we believe collaborative work brings benefit to higher education, to Stanford and to our staff.  Simple scale economies were the most obvious benefit. By working with other universities, we were able to develop software we needed at a fraction of the cost of building on our own. However, software economies were not the only benefit. As we worked with other institutions, we found that the process of collaboration was as important as getting a software product. The product became better because of shared expertise, and just as importantly, team members learned new techniques, extended their thinking and gained new ideas by working in a community of peers. 

The lessons from the project phase of Sakai, the economic and social values of collaboration, drive the communication and collaboration focus I would have on the Sakai Foundation board. While Sakai is off to a great start, there is much yet to be done. There are two major challenges, continuing to improve the software, and nurturing the multi-faceted Sakai community.  

The code base is good, but continued iteration would make it easier to install, support and extend, richer in features, and more elegant to use.  For this to be successfully accomplished the requirements process needs to be better integrated into the development process.  Better facilitation of communication between institutions will help to jumpstart emerging efforts and let potential collaborators find each other, and help community members know how they might contribute. Getting information about the status and plans for Sakai software needs to be simpler. 

Sakai has an active developers’ list and some workgroups and discussion groups benefit from excellent leadership, but effort towards broader communication would bring value to the wider Sakai community. For example, best practices for local integration and deployment, supporting faculty and students, and making innovative use of Sakai should be widely shared, allowing members of the community to learn from each other.  

To assure long term viability, the Sakai community needs to grow both in number of participants, and in strategic connections with other projects and organizations to better support interoperability and complementary roadmaps for product development. For this to happen, there needs to be a vision and roadmap for Sakai, and demonstrated value to community members. Sakai is a diverse community, and we need to seek ways to make participation valuable to all members, whether small or large colleges, teaching, technical or research institutions, adopters or support providers, and from any country. We need to assure a vibrant mix of educational, not for profit, and commercial members of the community, all committed to shared success. 

My commitment to Sakai, both personally and on behalf of Stanford, remains as enthusiastic as it was three years ago when we began this work. Two years of hard work on the Sakai project paid off in 2006, after the project evolved into the Foundation.  This is due in part to having a product to deploy, and also to being part of a larger community of peers. Over the past year,  I’ve had the opportunity to work with designers and programmers from several other schools on new projects for Sakai, have co-presented with colleagues at conferences, met with people from around the world who want to hear about Sakai and Stanford’s reasons for being part of the community, and engaged with others to solve emerging legal and policy issues. This is rewarding work that brings benefit to Stanford and to me, and I believe to the academic community as well. 

There are many ways to contribute to the Sakai Foundation and community, and while the Stanford team continues to participate in technology design and development, I would like to continue to participate in governance, working side by side with others to help the community thrive.

With kind regards, Lois

Over the past few years, Lois has been working with the Sakai project and Sakai Foundation to develop a sustainable model for collaborative software development in the higher education community.

As a practitioner in information technology, Lois is interested in developing models where rich suites of tools and services can be delivered to faculty and students while maintaining an affordable and sustainable IT infrastructure. As an outgrowth of work on Sakai, she has been investigating the factors related to adoption of community source software by higher education institutions. Her upcoming ECAR Research Bulletin, “Considering Open Source: A Framework for Evaluating Software in the New Economy” (January 2007) frames the issues an institution should consider when adding open source to the portfolio of hardware, software, infrastructure and services in an IT environment. She regularly presents on a variety of topics related to technology and innovative practices in academic computing.
