Participants will demonstrate the Sakai podcasting tool and the iTunes U portal tool. Panelists will also present user data from their Fall 2006 experiences at their institutions.

Within Sakai, there are a variety of different tools that institutions are using for podcasting. At Michigan, a portal was created for Sakai users to be automatically directed into their iTunes U page for their course or project site. At Indiana, a new podcasting tool for Sakai was created. Other campuses have developed their own deployment options, as well.

During this session, the presenters will build upon the Podcasting session at the Vancouver conference. Creation methods for podcasts will be discussed briefly. The majority of the session will include live demonstrations of the Podcasting and iTunes U portal tools. The presenters will also share user data and statistics from their Fall 2006 experiences at their institutions.

Launching a new application on campus is time-intensive and requires coordination and planning.  This working session assists Unicon’s clients in defining project goals, metrics, and gaining an understanding of both the strategic and tactical decisions that need to be made to ensure success.    The Unicon Facilitator demystifies the application jargon and assists the client in understanding the functionality and key implementation characteristics.  Once consensus is gained on the strategic direction, the session quickly turns to reviewing the necessary tactical decisions.  Tactical decisions include mapping out users, content, permissions, and, finally, combining each of these items in order to determine how content is displayed to the portal constituents.  A successful system implementation requires a combination of strategic and tactical planning.

We'll sort these strategies into a simple taxonomy and discuss the issues an institution may consider when architecting their migration processes. We'll discuss the Sakai ContentHostingService, digital repositories, SCORM, Zach Thomas's ImportService, IMS interchange/interoperability standards, RSS and distributed tooling, among other technologies. 
ajax;20060927 12:45:47;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Charles Severance recently described his vision of Sakai evolving into a "Swiss Army Knife of data exchange protocols." This session will provide a broad, example-driven overview of community efforts to date to realize Chuck's vision in the area of course content migration. We'll focus primarily on importing external content into Sakai, termed "transformative migration." Zach Thomas' work on a pluggable ImportService shows great promise in this area, and we'll spend a good part of the "transformative migration" discussion outlining his architecture. We'll also discuss what we've termed "proxied migrations," where a variety of remoting strategies allow Sakai to avoid taking full ownership of external data, and instead act as a delivery and aggregation layer, fulfilling a role we usually associate with Portals.

ajax;20060927 13:31:40;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This session will present results from three different surveys that asked instructors, students, and staff at two campuses to comment on their use and perceptions of the Michigan instance of Sakai. Similarities and differences between these populations will be discussed as well as how to use surveys to influence development.
ajax;20060927 13:31:40;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Surveys are often used as a way to evaluate technology systems and better understand how users are utilizing and/or having difficulty with the various features. Within Sakai, surveys are a highly useful tool to help developers, support personnel, and others understand how to improve the system for all users.

This session will present results from three different surveys that asked different populations of users about the Sakai instance at the University of Michigan (CTools). Instructors and students at the Ann Arbor campus were surveyed in April, 2006 while instructors and students at the Dearborn campus were surveyed in October, 2006. We also surveyed staff employees of the University from both campuses in October-November, 2006. 

Results from these surveys will help illuminate similarities and differences between types of users as well as campus populations. This session will conclude in a discussion of how best to use surveys and other user feedback to influence development and changes within Sakai.

ajax;20060927 17:02:53;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This talk summarizes an experience using Sakai for a distance education class during Spring semester, 2006, and the issues the emerged. Data were collected from students and during a post-semester interview with the instructor. Statement of issues and recommendations should help improve Sakai support for distance learning in the future.
ajax;20060927 17:02:53;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This is a case study of a wholly online class using Sakai, with a mixture of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, taught by an instructor with many years’ experience teaching at a distance. This talk will describe the methods, findings, and resulting recommendations from this case study.

Three methods were used to gather data: a survey of students, my own learner notes, and an interview with the instructor. On the whole, the class was a success, but a number of issues with Sakai emerged as needing attention from the Sakai community. In particular, the slow performance of and awkward navigation within the discussion tool were a barrier to learning. 

To the existing collection of Sakai usability, this study adds the perspective of a distance class, a perspective increasingly important as Sakai is adopted by institutions such as Charles Sturt University, “Australia’s largest provider of distance education.”
