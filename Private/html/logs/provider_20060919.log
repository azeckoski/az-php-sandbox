ajax;20060919 10:00:46;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Optimized Learning Inc.(OLi) is making it easy for schools of all sizes to begin exploring the power of Sakai. By utilizing our " remove the barriers" program OLi has helped many schools and commercial companies embrace the power of Sakai without redirecting IT staff our draining this years IT budget. Come See How!
ajax;20060919 10:00:46;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation will focus on how Optimized Learning is helping schools of all sizes embrace Sakai. Many schools would like to start small but don't have IT resources to dedicate to another on campus enterprise solution. By embracing our "remove the barriers program", OLi will walk schools through the process of how we have helped many two year and four year schools pilot Sakai as well as some of the work we are doing with commercial companies.  
The barriers we will be "removing" are:
Lack of funds for the up front hardware costs
Lack of training for the initial faculty involved
Lack of understanding of how to set Sakai up properly
Lack of technical support
Lack of instructor training
Plus many more....
OLI's main focus for this presentation is two fold:
Our first goal is to show schools that they don't have to throw out everything to start exploring Sakai. Start with a pilot and map towards succesful campus production if you feel Sakai is right for you. Our second goal is to show schools that they don't have to go it alone. The fears that keep many schools from starting a pilot have been eliminated by commercial companies. This session is an excellent way for the smaller schools interested in Sakai or for a teaching and learning with technology center to hear about how others are participating in the open source revolution. Thanks for your consideration.

Providing out of the box integration between Sakai and the industry–leading student information system Enterprise Campus Solutions as a first phase,  longer term the AEI will include integration with other Oracle solutions such as  Oracle Calendar and Oracle Content DB, as well as deliver analytics, dashboards and business processes. Utilizing an open, standards-based integration strategy, the AEI will provide the first end-to-end higher education enterprise solution while easing the effort and cost of implementing these mission-critical solutions.

The presentation will provide an overview of the Academic Enterprise Initiative, key architectural and technical issues that are being addressed, and tentative plans and timelines for availability. We will also devote a significant amount of time to questions and input from the audience.

ajax;20060919 19:20:45;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Cerritos College in Southern California is in the midst of a school-wide rollout of Sakai.  This presentation will discuss  Faculty and Student support, design and development issues, branding, a student use campaign, a faculty buy-in and use campaign and other issues that relate to bringing the open source platform to a PeopleSoft and MS SQL house. 
ajax;20060919 19:20:45;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Cerritos College has long been a leader among community colleges in innovation and the use of technology in the classroom.  Founded in 1955, it is one of the largest and most dynamic single-campus community college districts in California.  The college serves more than 23,000 students, more than 75% of whom are members of ethnic minority groups, a reflection of the diversity of the community Cerritos College serves.  
 
To meet the needs of its faculty and students, Cerritos College developed its own course management system in 2000, but soon discovered that a more dynamic, scalable, and affordable platform was needed.  After much research, the College joined the Sakai Educational Partners Program in 2005.As members, we sought not only the avail ourselves of the expertise of the SEPP membership, but to develop and distribute our own open source applications and enhancements.  To this end, Cerritos College has developed modifications to the Sakai open source code that allows the use of Microsoft SQL Server 2005.  This has profound implications for institutions of higher education running Microsoft-based servers.  The potential impact is particularly great for community colleges, many of whom lack the staff resources to modify such open source software to better meet their institutional needs.  This is the primary reason for the lack community college involvement in open source development. 
    Lack of support, design and IT resources has also been a factor in community college reluctance. In this presentation we will discuss our approach to student training and support, faculty training and support, as well as our roll out campaign.
