Unfortunately this can come into conflict with the true learner-centered purpose of eportfolios. The focus of this presentation is to describe the design of an eportfolio matrix to represent not only department, program or course goals but to also represent shifting personal goals.  As Tufts University’s Academic Technology eportfolio project team worked with the Boston School of Occupational Therapy instructors and students, a participatory design model evolved to more clearly represent all stakeholder goals – not just those of faculty. As the students ‘socially constructed’ the use of this new technology, they saw more meaning in attaching their work to personal goals in a flexible matrix.  Because the OSP matrix tool did not lend itself to that type of design, a presentation and forms were created to achieve the same goal.  

The matrices that I have seen have been created by someone other than the learner (being told what to do). Eportfolios are in the same boat. In many cases, they are being viewed as an assessment tool (for someone other than the student). How much buy-in and long-term learning will come from such "systems?"
