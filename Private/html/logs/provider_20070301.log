ajax;20070301 15:45:22;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation focuses on the benefits and process of developing an automated system to capture and publish Podcasts and lectures into Sakai. Schools whocapture and publish classes for out of class usage have seen improvements in grades, student satisfaction, and retention. A demo will be shown.
ajax;20070301 15:45:22;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The anticipated benefits of improved learning outcomes through models of reusable content, learning objects and course management systems have not been realized as broadly as we have hoped. Initiatives to publish standards and specifications like SCORM (Sharable Courseware Object Reference Model) and LOM (Learning Object Model) were embraced with an expected outcome of improvements in learning outcomes. We expected to see demonstrative academic benefits by implementing models of content authoring and tools to repurposing content in context to deliver a more personalized learning environment serving the needs of a wide range of students. Today, systems like Sakai are still lacking in rich media instructional content, as they are used more for class administration. 

      This presentation presents a perspective that lecture capture and Podcasting technologies can serve a valuable role in the improvement of student learning, as evaluated by grades, pass rates, reduction in course withdrawals and improvements in students’ satisfaction.  Although there is a lack of in-depth research, the early analyses show positive successes. Automating the lecture capture process and integrating them into Sakai is a simple and cost-effective way to quickly add content and value to the learning environment.
