ajax;20060824 11:05:12;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Several approaches to presentation technologies are compared and contrasted with regard to their use in Sakai.  Some of these are already present in Sakai, others are evaluated for use.
ajax;20060824 11:05:12;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:JavaServer Faces was chosen to be the de facto presentation technology for Sakai in the very early stages of the project.  A lot has been learned about using JSF since then.  The presentation explores the strengths and weaknesses of JSF and contrasts it with other presentation technologies including Servlets, JSP, Struts, XSLT, and Spring MVP.  New and emerging technologies are also explored for their potential including RSF, Facelets, XUL, and others.  Code examples will be used to illustrate important points.

This will be an overview of Java based presentation technologies and will serve to further the discussion of how Sakai should present it's user interface to users.
