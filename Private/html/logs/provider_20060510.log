Tools include: Wizards, Matrices, Forms, Portfolios, Styles, Layouts, Reports, Glossary. Also the new portal capabilities for Tab/Tool grouping will be discussed.

ajax;20060510 20:12:41;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The Plant Sciences Pedagogy Project at the University of Cambridge is seeking to develop evidence-informed practice in small-group teaching and learning. Sakai, and particularly the wiki tool, has been used effectively to support research, staff development and student learning. This may be a useful development model for other institutions.
ajax;20060510 20:12:41;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The Plant Sciences Pedagogy Project at the University of Cambridge is developing evidence-informed practice in small-group teaching and is analysing how this can be supported by online tools.

Sakai has been used as a virtual collaboration environment throughout the project: it has proved sufficiently flexible to be used for the initial research collaboration, as well as for discussion and analysis. The wiki has been shown to be a powerful learning tool offering a wide range of generic functionalities not available in conventional VLEs to support student learning. In some cases, the research needs identified could be addressed directly using existing Sakai tools; in other cases, we had to combine tools or apply them in innovative ways.
 
Sakai has provided a means of enhancing existing practice and a forum for discussion of that practice. It can also provide a lever to encourage further change within the teaching practices of the University.

ajax;20060510 20:15:43;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Different types of campuses have varying levels of expertise in instructional technology amongst faculty.  Faculty must first learn how to access/use Sakai – but this alone does not improve pedagogy.  We must also support curriculum / content development. This panel presents four approaches to training and faculty support on their campuses.
ajax;20060510 20:15:43;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The four panelists will present a broad range of approaches to faculty support for Sakai.  The goal of the panel, is to present options for those campuses that are just thinking about faculty support for Sakai, or campuses that have already tried some approaches and are looking for new or different ways to reach their faculty.  Most importantly, the panel will present any lessons learned in the processes they have set up on their campuses, or, in the case of Unicon, in their offerings to faculty and/or campuses.

Topics to be covered will include onsite training, online training, trainer certification, roles/services that commercial affiliates can provide on your campus, students partnering with faculty, pedagogical support, faculty mentoring faculty, teaching and learning centers, and other organizational approaches to organized faculty support for Sakai.

The panelists will present how their faculty support units are organized, the types of support they offer, lessons learned,  what’s working / what’s not working, and where applicable, what they are doing to offer pedagogical support.

This content may exist in many different locations, some local, some remote, originating from both commercial and public sources.  Many institutions are looking seriously at digital repositories as part of the technical infrastructure required to assist the management of relevant digital content.  Additionally, digital repositories may be presented remotely and used to serve content locally as required.

Based on current thinking at Stanford and Hull Universities around Sakai and Fedora, and taking a lead from the Technology Analysis of Repositories work at Johns Hopkins, this session will explore the relationship between Sakai and digital repositories.  It will investigate this in the wider context of the boundary between content sources and information access.  Attendees will share experiences and learn how to plan for the successful long-term cooperation between these two systems according to their needs.

Following a progress report on the Sakaibrary project, this presentation will focus on the issue of how citations and lists of citations (reference lists) are used in today’s academic environment and how Sakai can become citation-aware as part of becoming library-aware. Requirements, design, and current implementation status will be shared.

Attendees will learn about the work planned under the umbrella of the Sakaibrary project, including new citation-related functionality in Sakai 2.2 and work planned for the 2.3 release. Attendees unfamiliar with the project but interested in contributing will learn how they can participate to move the effort forward.

Members of the Open Source Portfolio community were actively involved in the development of the IMS Global Learning Consortium ePortfolio Specification, and several developers have contributed to the effort to implement the specification. However, the fact that OSP is in production serving diverse needs at multiple institutions make achieving meaningful interoperability more than just a technical challenge. The OSP community is developing a shared set of data structures and vocabulary that we hope will be able to capture this diverse practice in a form that maps productively to and from the IMS specification. This session will discuss the future of standards and specifications in OSP development. Participants will be invited to examine and discuss the draft core elements, their mappings to IMS ePortfolio, the role of other standards, such as RSS, Atom, FOAF, and the IMS Tool Portability Profile.

Project management is even more difficult when targeting a large multi-layered collaborative environment like Sakai. However, by following a few central principles, small cross-disciplinary teams can deliver on spec on time -- even in Sakai. Drawing on real-world experience and code, we'll show how to shield your team and your end users from disruptions to schedules and functionality. Time will be left for follow-up discussion.

Since January 2006 we have been testing CANS in eight Sakai hosted courses at University of Missouri.  This session presents work in progress on how data collected by the CANS system can be used to analyze and visualize both instructor and student activities that occur in Sakai course and project sites.

The presentation also describes an evolving methodology that supports both research and development activities in Sakai created by combining tools and techniques from the CANS system, information visualization, data mining, and statistical analysis.

Clustering is a data mining technique that applies when instances are to be divided into natural groups. We analyzed data from our current VLE(Blackboard) and data from two pilots (Sakai & OSP). We can divide our courses into four (natural) groups: largest group (87%) can be characterized as 'basic usage'. This group mainly used 'resources' and 'announcements'. The other groups can be characterized as 'basic usage' plus additional tools like discussionboard or gradebook.
Additional to the course analysis we applied clustering to the following instances 'faculty', 'student', 'sessions' and 'content items'.
The audience will learn how we applied clustering techniques in order to analyze VLE usage data and how the results impact our policies.

This is achived using RSAC (RSF's lightweight IoC container) and the OTP (One True Path) EL system, together with concepts such as the "Alteration Wrapper".

Experimental Phonetics have been evaluated. The issue of pedagogical

are the benefits of using a web-based tool to teach Experimental 
Phonetics? What Sakai tools did the students like and dislike and why?
These and other questions will be addressed along with suggestions to improve the tool's pedagogical efficiency.
The authors would also like to initiate a discussion on how to implement the European ECTS grading scale according to the Bologna process.

We will discuss the technical features of the tool, and demonstrate how this tool could help ease the conversion from active course site into OCW copy, hence increase the scalability of OCW practice.

In order to help automating the process of OCW migration and reducing the cost, the new OCW tool in sakai helps to generate a large number of open educational objects as quickly and easily as possible, manage the use of metadata across the system, and exports course materials with IMS CP format. eduCommons tool then uses workflow tool to help finally publish the course.
