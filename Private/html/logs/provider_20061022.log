ajax;20061022 17:27:44;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:By this stage I think we can take the shared values of community source as read.  We know what got us in the door, but now it's time to affirm what's going to keep us in the room, and I think this is the current challenge of Sakai leadership: the next stage of maturity will be found in recognizing and harnessing the "economic" fundamentals of what will make this collaboration successful for those who have already bought into the vision.

A sober-eyed view reminds us that although we benefit from a self-motivated voluntarism in many individuals, the success of Sakai will really require the voluntarism that is an extension of the institutional will.  If people from many schools are contributing time and effort, it is largely because their administration has committed them to it.  I think we can do more to encourage school administrations to expand this commitment, by identifying or establishing clear connections between efforts and results.  We can improve the ability for institutions to account for their investment in community source.
ajax;20061022 17:27:44;/election/add_entry.php;validate:required:Though a U.S. citizen, Clay grew up in South Korea, and only returned to the States for his university education.  He received his undergraduate degree from Colorado College, and his M.S. in High Energy Astrophysics from Iowa State University in 1995.  He finished this degree with the conviction that teaching was a more compelling pursuit for him than the life of a research astronomer, and in fact at the time he left with his degree he was teaching in both the physics and philosophy departments, and writing popular astronomy articles for publication.  

Seeking to combine this pedagogical interest with a desire to return overseas, he spent the next three years in rural South Africa, a volunteer in educational and community development.  His chief responsibility was a set of primary schools and their villages in the Sotho homelands, but he also worked closely with provincial offices in acquiring donations of books and computers from international investors, and establishing grant-funded libraries and computer literacy programs for educators.

Upon returning to the States in 1999 he moved to Boston to enter a master's program in Philosophy at Boston University, and he parlayed his experience doing computer modeling in gamma ray astronomy to acquire a job in the IT department there - initially just for the tuition remission while he pursued his own studies.  But a professional philosophical interest was once again eclipsed by a fascination with the computer as both a social tool and a medium of instruction.  He became the administrator for the course management systems at the School of Management, helped develop some of its courses for online delivery, and taught a few of his own astronomy and calculus courses online as well.  Late in 2003 he became the Associate Director for Academic Computing.

Since he spearheaded the School of Management's entry into the Sakai partnership in early 2004, he has been a vocal and active member of the community at a number of levels, ranging from the QA working group and release documentation, through Strategy and Advocacy discussions which shaped the Foundation by-laws, and to the community practice working group which seeks to articulate the practices by which the Sakai community collaborates.  He was made a Sakai Fellow in May of 2006.  Throughout, his keenest interest has been in the nature and health of the organization and the community source model.
