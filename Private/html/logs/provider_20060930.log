A few really got into the culture and code, but most found it overwhelming. It took a few individuals’ specific actions to open the doors for others.

It was and is not easy for developers and other staff members at Unisa to become part of Sakai, especially the less technical staff. The community was extremely helpful with wonderful assistance, but it took a few individuals to actively participate in specific activities to open doors for others. One became part of the weekly meeting in the resource group. More had to learn to regularly read the email, jump in and participate, not to be too shy. We are still learning to share what we have and to believe others can be interested and benefit from it. We want to share this growing experience

IT Training & Education works closely with our partners on the support and implementation team, the Knowledge Base, the Support Center, the Teaching and Learning Centers, and the Communications & Planning Office, to develop an integrated help environment that makes it simple for faculty, students and staff to find the right support for them. The transition to a new environment allowed our teams to reexamine the ways we collaborate and integrate efforts. New challenges have presented new opportunities. Survival isn’t enough. We need to thrive. Join us for a presentation and roundtable discussion of best practices which eliminate support barriers.

The Dissertation Checklist presents the process for completing the doctoral degree in one personalized view. Sakai members want to try Grad Tools, but first it was necessary to have a version of the Dissertation Checklist that was not scoped to Michigan processes and could be installed and used at other institutions. Sakai members also recognized that such a tool might be used to communicate other workflows, academic and administrative.  These were the requirements used by Michigan to design a Sakai Checklist, implemented with Hibernate and JavaServer Faces. In the Tool Carousel I will focus on the Sakai Checklist, its use by Sakai members in creating Grad Tools environments at their institutions, and other applications for checklists, shared or individual.  I can also share a thought or two about what might be required to interest others in collaboration.

Suggestions for enhancements e, new features, and tools are submitted through an online form and tracked and cataloged through an enterprise technology support management system.

The FRC is a group of academic, library and technology service providers who analyze the suggestions and then define functional requirements for the suggested enhancements.  The FRC works closely with the Oncourse Priorities Committee (OPC), which is a group of faculty responsible for setting the development priorities. The focus of this session will be on how these two committees work efficiently together to set development priorities. We will share lessons learned as we refined this process including the need for an OPC full day retreat to discuss the recommendations outlined by FRC before voting on development priorities.

ajax;20060930 22:50:26;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:A case study of a small, focused collaboration between 3 schools - UNISA, Whitman College, and Boston University - to meet a set of shared requirements for the Resources tool. The experience is traced from requirements voting through implementation and inclusion in the Sakai release.  
ajax;20060930 22:50:26;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Following the requirements voting results in April, representatives from a few schools came together to try to satisfy Resources requirements that were critical for their respective deployments.  Jim Eng, the project lead, was approached, and over the course of the next few months these requirements were honed, a design was achieved, the development work was completed, and then it was QA'ed and deployed outside the Sakai release cycle.  These features are now a part of the 2.3 release.

This session offers primarily a recounting of this experience: its process, successes and failures.  There are also broader lessons to be drawn for how more focused collaborations can operate within the Sakai community, for risk management, and a judicious allocation of limited local resources to meet local needs, while yet benefitting the wider project.
