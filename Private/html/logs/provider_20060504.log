Currently, we are stuck with six years of proprietary course archives and a 50% faculty usage rate with nearly every student using the commercial system every semester. Dedicated support to the LMS on our campus is 1.5 FTE. One new position has been made to support OSP. But, is it possible? We explore the costs from a variety of angles. We'll offer what we found as best of breed upstart advice and optimum setups for thin support teams like our own. Can the little guy make the change, too (without all that funding)? Maybe so.

For this reason, it�s mandatory to offer our students an interaction depending on their languages preferences.
Reaching this goal is a challenge because Sakai has several limitations relating to I18N and L10N. However, with a carefully planning is possible to design a strategy to overcome these limitations.
The presentation will be divided into five main sections: a) UPV needs and objectives in i18n; b) Sakai restrictions and limitation to reach these objectives; c) A practical example: Sakai translation into Spanish; d) Related and Further work; e) Conclusions.

The presentation will give an objective view of the advantages and disadvantages of m-learning, describes a number of issues from various points of view and suggests an outlook for the application of the technology in the near future. Finally, it will propose a web service oriented framework to integrate m-learning into a Sakai-based educational portal.

ajax;20060504 10:23:24;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:As one of the original members of the Sakai Project, MIT has long supported the idea of a collaboration and learning environment (CLE), but limitations of the current user interface have prevented it's adoption.  We present a solution that allows Sakai tools to be integrated and used in the existing Stellar environment by creating an integrated Sakai service platform.
ajax;20060504 10:23:24;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:MIT has extended the Sakai Kernel Bundle concept to include most of the legacy services needed to support tool such as the Gradebook and Message Center.  Services included in this platform were integrated with existing Stellar and MIT data sources allowing tools to be launched from the Stellar user environment.  This approach preserves the established UI environment being used to deliver more than half of MIT's courses at this time, avoids expensive re-training, and allows new tools based on Sakai to be used.

The presentation covers a definition of the platform, how it was integrated to MIT enterprise data, and specific challenges including user session management, access to tools and components via the Sakai kernel, and merging Sakai tool interfaces into Stellar in a way that maximizes the user experience.

Our student electronic portfolio (ePort) is designed to help us address these challenges by enhancing and deepening student learning and providing authentic evidence for assessment to guide faculty as they seek to improve learning.  Working with OSP and Sakai, we have been developing and piloting our ePort for several years. Using the ePort not only to assess learning but also to integrate and enhance learning has been a focus of the evolution of our portfolio. We thus have a wealth of lessons learned to share with colleagues at other institutions about curricular and pedagogical capacities of the OSP-Sakai combination. This session will demonstrate the current iteration of our portfolio, data about its influence on student learning and engagement, lessons learned, and future directions.

ajax;20060504 10:25:30;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This session illustrates lessons learned and provides recommendations for institutions contemplating the introduction of open-source applications while maintaining enterprise vendor software.  Beginning in 2004 Virginia Tech introduced the open-source portfolio (OSP) and course management system (SAKAI) to the university community and faced the management and pedagogical implications of open-source products.
ajax;20060504 10:25:30;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:By combining Virginia Tech�s experience offering a vendor software (Blackboard) with our experience taking a lead role in developing open source solutions (OSP and SAKAI), we have gained valuable insight into what is involved in offering an enterprise learning system..  This presentation will involve participants in addressing the management and pedagogical issues that VT encountered closing with  lessons learned and recommendations for institutions. 

Our experience has shown that open-source initiative involvement  requires substantial resources in the areas of quality assurance, development, user support, and training.  However, the flexibility of open-source products offers the potential to address specific pedagogical and research needs which in turn provides a better experience for our users.  This session will provide institutions contemplating the adoption of open-source products with the perspective of a fellow institution which has already chosen to "shake the vending machine" by joining the open-source initiative while maintaining a vendor enterprise level product.

Whether one individual or a team, using simple or complex infrastructure with MySQL or Oracle in pilot or production, Ops teams have faced and overcome challenges and have tips and tricks to share.
ajax;20060504 10:33:28;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Operations teams are the people in the trenches: those behind the scenes keeping campus applications running smoothly, responding in the middle of the night should something break.  But choosing the “right�? hardware infrastructure, calculating capacity, predicting usage, tuning for optimal performance, or monitoring the “right�? failure thresholds that meet the needs of your campus can prove challenging tasks.  

How do you make decisions so Sakai won’t fail during finals?  Does your SLA require “5 Nines�? availability?  When you encounter service performance inefficiencies, can you provide feedback to Sakai developers so they can assist in achieving your production operations goals?  What have others done?  Do guidelines exist that you should be using to answer these questions?

System and Database Administrators from SEPP campuses bring their experiences to a panel discussion.  After brief institutional approach summaries, the floor opens for informal exchange of ideas, concerns, questions, and paths taken to meet challenges faced.

ajax;20060504 10:34:42;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation will look at user interface design patterns for the purposes of generating common design paradigms in a collaborative fashion across disparate organizations and/or campuses. A UI design pattern provides a description of a common UI design problem and good solutions to that problem that can be applied in many different ways. 
ajax;20060504 10:34:42;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Coming to consensus in any project is often times a contentious process. Programming tends to be a loosely coupled task allowing developers to work independently. How then should team members in a widely dispersed community like Sakai approach user interface design and development?

To better aid the design process across disparate organizations and/or campuses, we recommend user interface design patterns to capture common UI design problems and solutions that can be applied and interpreted in many different ways. Typically, a UI design pattern is a representation of something used repeatedly in design with problem statements, use cases, solution, rationale, and accompanying examples. By encoding common knowledge, design patterns can help ensure consistent user experiences that are empirically sound and justified.

We will look at design patterns as they have been developed in a user interface design pattern library at UC Berkeley. Using campus sites as well as Berkeley's Sakai implementation of bSpace, Sakai community members can learn more about UI design patterns and how it may foster better understanding and communication of ideas.

ajax;20060504 10:43:32;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Until recently, Sakai has relied on a relatively simple model for representing enterprise data.  As Sakai's users and tools have grown more sophisticated, the community has recognized the need for making new kinds of enterprise data available within the Sakai environment.

In order to provide richer enterprise data to Sakai, the CourseManagement Work Group, with the help of the broader Sakai community, has designed and implemented new services to reveal enterprise-defined course hierarchies, memberships, and enrollments inside Sakai.  These new services allow Sakai groups and sites to be linked to entities in the course hierarchy, and also allow tools to display data previously unavailable in sakai: enrollment credits, enrollment status, and grading options such as pass/fail.

This presentation will demonstrate the new capabilities provided by the Course Management services and will offer systems integrators the chance to see several different strategies for integrating the services with their enterprise systems.

Due to the changes in the educational landscape these institutions merged.  They subsequently had to rewrite the LMS systems which were different in function and appearance.  Instead of rewriting, Unisa decided in 2005 to go the SAKAI route for a new LMS.  
The focus of this paper is about the change management processes and not about the tools we had to develop.  A change management plan was developed which would govern the way we rolled out SAKAI.  
After being live for two months we had 65 000 students’ online.  We are currently averaging 2 million hits a day.  Is this indicative of a successful roll-out?  
The critical questions asked were: 
•	Did we manage the process of change effectively? 
•	Are there any important lessons learned that can be of benefit to anyone else rolling out such a big installation of SAKAI?

This workshop will be a hands-on working session to develop practical pedagogical practices that will work within the current Sakai 2.1 framework and help designers and faculty to move beyond their current use of technology toward their ideals. After an initial introduction and sharing a few examples of how PSU faculty have pushed the technology, participants will divide into groups, each with a specific use case scenario, to develop and share ideas on how to use Sakai to meet specific pedagogical goals. These best practices will then be captured and made available via confluence for the entire Sakai community.

ajax;20060504 11:04:08;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation/discussion examines the diverse experiences with Sakai provided as a service to forty-four small colleges and two consortia.

Institutions with fewer than 5,000 students – some with as few as 500 students – have a clear stake in the deployment of Sakai.   Awareness of Sakai in this numerous group of schools is growing but they lack (or believe they lack) the technical resources to implement Sakai and face real fiscal challenges in licensing commercial systems.  

We’ll discuss the advantages individual schools realize by integrating the loosely coupled Sakai framework with their local authentication and ERP services, and how these consumers of Sakai take charge of their systems and efficiently shift from piloting to full-scale production.  An analysis of the faculty and student experience with Sakai in full production will be presented.

Consortia are providing Sakai as a service to their members on a cost-effective basis to meet both pilot and production needs.  While multitenancy on a single instance of Sakai encourages content sharing among institutional members, there are challenges for maintaining campus identity and binding authentication services.  Consortial instances of Sakai for small schools are important opportunities for federated authentication through tools such as Shibboleth.

We will close with an analysis of total costs of ownership or access based on our experience in supporting 58 institutions’ use of Sakai, and as time allows, report on initial consortial uses of OSP 2.1.

ajax;20060504 11:15:23;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:TwinPeaks, introduced in Sakai 2.1, is changing for Sakai 2.2. Results of searching library resources can be used in many places and many ways that have not been possible before in Sakai. We will discuss the implementation of Citations, CitationLists and a CitationService and how they might be used to provide alternative ways of accessing documents, images and other resources in many Sakai tools.
ajax;20060504 11:15:23;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation will be of special interest to tool developers, UI designers and librarians. For librarians, it will be an important follow-on to the Sakaibrary presentation by Mark Notess and Jon Dunn.  For developers and designers, it will provide timely information about how they can integrate the new capabilities of TwinPeaks and Citations into the tools they develop/maintain. The search and citation capabilities have the potential to change the way people use resources in Sakai.

ajax;20060504 12:09:41;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Unisa’s implementation of Sakai, myUnisa, contains many features that support the needs of a large community of distance education students. Nineteen additional learning and administrative tools were developed. This talk will cover the process that led to their development. A brief overview and demonstration of these tools will be given.
ajax;20060504 12:09:41;/conference/admin/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:myUnisa implementation in January 2006 was the culmination of months of planning and technology investigations. Development work was preceded by a requirements gathering phase and eventually led to a gap analysis study between the existing LMS systems and Sakai. 

Workshops with academic staff and online surveys of 2005 students provided a rather daunting list of features and functionality for the ideal myUnisa. While Sakai proved to fit the technology direction Unisa wanted to follow, many tools required to support distance education students had to be developed in-house. To fit our deployment due date, Sakai version 2.0.1 was selected. Unisa User Requirements Documentation was adapted to incorporate the Sakai Style Guide and allow myUnisa tools to fit seamlessly. 

Tools were divided into three groups, i.e. tools for subject sites, administrative tools for students and student management tools for lecturers. The development and functionality of these tools will be described and demonstrated.
