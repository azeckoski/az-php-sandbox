These suggest possible avenues for more detailed research, provide baseline data against which to compare future usage, activity patterns and provides insights for further development and planning.
ajax;20060929 03:57:24;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Using data mining techniques, information is extracted from our activity records for the period February – September 2006. Data is presented giving an overview of when students are online, from where and when students engage in particular types of activities. The analysis confirms some assumptions we’ve made as well and also uncovers some associations which would otherwise not have been revealed. 

An important enabling factor is that real time activity data is captured by Sakai, which can be used for many different purposes, such as helping facilitators of online learning to develop a more nuanced understanding of how learning environments are used. The process of extracting this data has also heightened awareness about the importance of recording meaningful data and improving analysis techniques.

Many of the academics didn’t even seem to notice that the new system was in place – this, in spite of a university-wide campaign of email announcements, workshops and hands-on training sessions.

The students first started whining in letters of complaint about academics not using myUnisa. Then, the whines started coming from the academics: “What are these students complaining about?” 

In order to overcome some of the problems associated with this new learning technology, several departments now work together to help educate academic staff to use myUnisa to enhance their distance teaching and learning. This presentation will outline the phases of the staff development side of the myUnisa roll-out, and then present some case studies of our successes and tribulations.

We will discuss our architecture, which has a few unique aspects. We are running our Sakai implementation on load balanced VM sessions, which are fronted by a NetScaler. On the backend, we are using an Oracle DB server and a BlueArc NAS for file storage. Other unique aspects of our implementation include the use of both CAS and Kerberos authentication. We have developed java code that uses Web Services to provision Sakai course sites from Banner data. We will discuss the process involved and issues that arose. We will briefly talk about our rollout from a pilot to a production system and how Sakai has been viewed on our campus. Some basic usage statistics and user feedback will be presented.

ajax;20060929 10:18:53;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:We present the results of a usability evaluation of the course management features of Sakai. The evaluation consists of lab sessions with five representative users and a walkthrough by a practicing usability professional. The usability problems and suggested solutions have been reviewed with three Sakai developers.
ajax;20060929 10:18:53;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Scholar, Virginia Tech's implementation of Sakai, is a new integrated learning, collaboration, and research support system. A preview of Scholar (Sakai) is currently available for use by Virginia Tech administrators, faculty, and students. In addition to helping the Scholar (Sakai) team find and fix implementation and performance issues, the preview serves as an ideal mechanism for evaluating the appropriateness of the application. An appropriate application should not only provide functionality that facilitates the tasks of its users, but also be usable. Usability is defined as the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with which users of the application are able to complete tasks. The more usable Scholar (Sakai) is, the more likely it will be quickly adopted by Virginia Tech administrators, faculty, and staff.

The presentation will contain the following:
• A description of the methods and tools used to collect usability data on Scholar (Sakai)
• A discussion of major usability findings
• Feedback from Scholar (Sakai) developers on their impressions of the usability evaluation and potential solutions to usability problems

We expect the audience to take away the following:
• An understanding of what usability is at a high level and why it is important for open source projects
• General usability issues in Sakai and ways to address them

ajax;20060929 10:29:00;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Virginia Tech and the University of Central Florida both won Educause’s prestigious EDUCAUSE award for Systemic Progress in Teaching and Learning for their very different approaches to faculty development.  Come hear how these different approaches to faculty development have each led to campus-wide pedagogical impact on their respective campuses.
ajax;20060929 10:29:00;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Since 1993, Virginia Tech’s Faculty Development Institute (FDI) has institutionally tied computer replacement to training on a recurring 4-year cycle. i.e. ~25% of faculty participate each year in this formal program (about 450-480 each year). Focus is on enhancing teaching/learning and other aspects of faculty life (i.e. research productivity).  Each semester they also teach 150-200 short courses open to the university (faculty, grad assistants, staff).
  
Since 1996, the University of Central Florida (UCF) has been providing systematic support for faculty developing and delivering online courses – whether fully online, hybrid, or simply Web-enhanced.  Each year, approximately 60 faculty receive extensive instructional design and multi-media creation support to develop and deliver online courses.  The initiative encompasses 14 online degree programs and hundreds of hybrid and Web-enhanced courses (over 3,200 online courses overall).

This session will present these two faculty development approaches and provide ample time for Q&A from the audience.

Four screen reader users will demonstrate and discuss techniques for web-based applications, including Sakai. A related BOF will give developers and designers hands-on experience using JAWS, the most common screen reader.
ajax;20060929 11:51:21;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This presentation goes beyond the usual status update to help designers and developers understand how persons with disabilities experience web-based applications. Screen reader users will demonstrate and discuss their experiences with "good" and "bad" examples, including Sakai.

Our plan is to feature four screen reader users from Sakai-partner institutions, who either use Sakai as students or provide support to persons with disabilities on their campuses. The format will be a brief introduction of each of the panelists, their description of the techniques they use while navigating a site, and then a panel review/critique of Sakai. Q and A will follow.

I’m working with Robert Todd and Donna Llewellyn at Tech to arrange student and staff participation at the conference. The presentation and panel discussion could conceivably take place virtually, and feature JAWS users from other institutions, but I would prefer to have participation in person, since it minimizes the complexity.

ajax;20060929 13:57:57;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:This session  reports on the Mellon-funded “Integrating Licensed Library Resources with Sakai” project to facilitate accessing library content through Sakai course sites.  Support for citations and citation lists as objects within Sakai will be shown,  and a  progress report, including user testing results and pilot project plans will be given.
ajax;20060929 13:57:57;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The Sakaibrary project has completed its first phase of implementation, providing support for discovery and use of licensed resource content within Sakai through integration with library metasearch tools (SRSI SingleSearch and Metalib X-Server), along with tools for constructing, viewing, and exporting citation lists. As part of the talk, a brief demonstration of Sakaibrary capabilities will be shown.

With the completion of the first phase of implementation, user tests were conducted to assess the usability and usefulness of Sakaibrary from the perspective of librarians, students, and instructors, uncovering a number of issues to be addressed in phase two development, or to be forwarded on to the keepers of other Sakai tools. Plans for pilot projects testing Sakaibrary phase one in actual classes will be described.

Attendees will also learn about the work planned under the umbrella of the Sakaibrary project, including plans and schedules for future development.

We will talk about enabling the debugging interface in Tomcat, attaching a debugger in Eclipse, strategies for estimating where in the codebase the problem might lie, adding breakpoints, examining variables, and deploying changes. I will also show how to pull a patch out of Jira and apply it to your own code, as well as how to use facilities in Subversion to apply larger updates from the Sakai repository to your local code.

ajax;20060929 15:49:04;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The Section Info tool enables instructors to create official course subgroupings or sections, e.g., Labs, Recitations, that are also revealed in various tools, e.g., Resources. Instructors may add Teaching Assistants and Students to Sections, describe meeting places and times, set maximum enrollment limits and optionally allow Students themselves to sign up for and switch sections. We'll demonstrate these features, discuss what's missing and go over the road map. 
ajax;20060929 15:49:04;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The original design of the Section Info tool was a compromise forced by, among other things, Sakai's generic framework integration options. With the availability of a full-fledged Course Management API in the upcoming 2.3 release, significant changes are planned for the tool in 2.4. It's relative prominence in the overall tool set will undoubtedly grow -- especially for larger institutiosn with complex course hierarchies -- as a result of this upcoming work.  Eventually we foresee the functionality in Section Info and Site Info's Add Group and Add User capabilities merging into a general User Management tool.

Librarians then meet with class sections to introduce reference sources and other tools to help students revise and edit their original entries.  Eventually students will compare their revised entries with those in Wikipedia and The Encyclopaedia Britannica.

We'll demonstrate these features, discuss what's missing and go over the road map. 
ajax;20060929 16:17:07;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:The original design of the Section Info tool was a compromise forced by, among other things, Sakai's generic framework integration options. With the availability of a full-fledged Course Management API in the upcoming 2.3 release, significant changes are planned for the tool in 2.4. It's relative prominence in the overall tool set will undoubtedly grow -- especially for larger institutions with complex course hierarchies -- as a result of this upcoming work.  Eventually we foresee the functionality in Section Info and Site Info's Add Group and Add User capabilities merging into a general User Management tool.

ajax;20060929 17:45:42;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Marist College has recently expanded our production implementation of Sakai while at the same time migrating to version 2.2.1.  We are now in the process of developing a strategy for transitioning our entire faculty body to Sakai.  Our migration plan and long-term strategy will be discussed at this session.
ajax;20060929 17:45:42;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Marist’s NSF-funded fully online Institute for Data Center Professionals (IDCP) program has been in full production with Sakai since March. We have recently expanded use of Sakai to include additional IDCP cohorts and a new online program funded by the New York State Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research.

The decision was made to upgrade from 2.1.1 to 2.2.1 ahead of the start of these new cohorts and program.  A migration plan that addressed the need for course development to begin in version 2.2.1 before final migration was completed was successfully implemented.  A “functionality analysis”, part of our CMS strategy planning, is being developed to compare current functionality to our future needs.

A communication strategy is being implemented to engage our faculty in a dialog on Sakai’s future at Marist.  At the same time, we are developing a two-year transition plan for moving the entire College to Sakai.

ajax;20060929 17:51:13;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Marist College, through an IBM Shared University Research Grant IBM, has developed an “enterprise-level” version of Sakai that leverages IBM’s Websphere Portal Server and DB2 Content Manager.  Now in production, this system is part of a long-term content management strategy and vision for a “national learning grid” of Sakai-based content repositories.
ajax;20060929 17:51:13;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Last year, Marist secured a Shared University Research grant from IBM to fund Sakai-related development activities through the IBM Joint Study Project (an academically-focused program based at Marist).  The work has focused on the porting of Sakai to WebSphere Portal Server and the integration of IBM’s DB2 Content Manager using open standards.  All code will be contributed back to Sakai.

A team of Marist students, IT staff and IBM researcher has completed the initial technical work and has now moved this enterprise version of Sakai into production, supporting a new fully online program.

Having an enterprise-level content repository behind Sakai will ensure that it will scale to meet the College’s future digital repository needs, which are expected to grow exponentially.  It is also part of a long-term vision of a “national learning grid” of Sakai-based content repositories that would allow groups, such as K-12 schools, to share content between installations.

In particular, the Gradebook enables instructors to: enter, view, edit and release to students their scores and grades; automatically receive assignments scores from other tools (e.g., Samigo); filter student lists by section; establish and edit a mapping of the course letter grade to a 100 percent scale; autocalculate course grades 
export scores and grades in excel, csv format; keep a log of grading activity. In addition, the Sakai 2.3 Gradebook enables instructors to import assignment scores from csv format and more selectively to control the release of assignment scores to students.

We'll demonstrate these features, discuss what's missing and go over the tool's road map. Specifically, we’ll be discussing our efforts to work collaboratively on future  development for categories & weighting.

* share existing and future ideas of Repository OSID use within Sakai (this will start with the panel and then be open to the audience).
* discuss possibilities for interoperability between ideas.

In the previous Sakai Conference, there was a rather large BOF and much e-mail discussion on the topic of Repositories in general in Sakai and the intersection of the Repository OSID.  This session would act as a follow-up to that BOF/discussion, highlighting the Sakaibrary Project's work accessing "repositories" (metasearch engines) in Sakai through use of the Repository OSID.

Adoption at UC Berkeley has grown exponentially from our pilot of 50  faculty and 4500 students in Fall 2005 to the Fall 2006 usage of nearly 1000 faculty and 26,000 students in the first month of classes. This success is due, in part, to clear communication with the campus about the change, training & support scaffolding provided by Educational Technology Services, and the general ease of use of Sakai. Sharing our model with new adopters is an opportunity that should not be missed.

ajax;20060929 22:37:28;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Yale's Controlled Web Access tool provides a mechanism for instructors to determine access to an external static course website by role on a folder level.  The paired external server allows users to log in through Sakai and receives authorization information from Sakai via web services.  The session will include a discussion of the tool as a model for using Sakai to perform authorization for external university services in the abstract.

ajax;20060929 22:37:28;/conference/proposals/edit_proposal.php;validate:required:Yale's Controlled Web Access project allows instructors to use a Sakai tool interface to protect a course website on an external server with Sakai course membership and role information.  These sites are accessible to students directly on the web, inside Sakai through a Web Content tool-like iframe, and via WebDAV.  Login always occurs through Sakai, and is only required when the site's permissions are set to disallow anonymous login and the user does not currently have a Sakai session.  A simple web service is used to provide for communication between the two elements, including
permissions information and configuration commands. This tool could also be used as a model for using Sakai's course membership, role data, and other permissions for protecting and providing integrated login with other University services.
