<h1>What's New in Version 4.5.4</h1>
The development team is focused on the next minor release of Mambo, v4.6.  However, we do realize that many users will continue to use the 4.5.x branch for some time to come.  Therefore, we have decided to updated / stabilize this branch a bit further while we work on the 4.6 branch.  Enjoy!

1) Updated TinyMCE from v2.0.2 to 2.0.6.1<BR>
2) Updated overLIB from 4.06 to 4.21<BR>
3) Added 453h security patch 1 to default install.  No extra download needed.<BR>
4) Fixed a Trash Manager issue<BR>
5) Patched a low risk RSS vulnerability<BR>
