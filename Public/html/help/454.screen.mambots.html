<h1>Mambot Manager</h1>
<p><span>Mambots are essentially code snippets which when called via various parameters either activate a program, script or perform a specific function. They can be as simple as a function which replaces typed text with code (such as typing to display an image in a content item) to full fledged third party libraries (such as WYSIWYG editors or other programs).<br /><br />
<p align="left"><span>Mambots are divided into 4 types/categories that may be displayed by filtering in the filter field: <br /></span></p><ul><li>content</li><li><span>editors</span></li><li><span>editors-xtd</span></li><li><span>search</span><span></span></li></ul><h3><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Toolbar Icons</span></h3><p>Select a Mambot by clicking on the checkbox next to its name.</p><p><strong>Publish/ Unpublish</strong>: Click the icon to Publish or Unpublish the Mambot.</p><p><strong>New</strong>:&nbsp; Click the &quot;New&quot; icon to create a new Mambot.
