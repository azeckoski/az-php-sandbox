<h1>Contact Manager</h1>

<p align="right">-- Draft&nbsp; version</p>The Contact Manager, allows you to manage a list of contacts for your site. This allows visitors to find contact information for different people or departments. <br /><br />Name: This is the name of the contact, this can be a person, department or whatever you wish. This is what shows up on the Frontend of the site. You can click the name to edit that contact.<br /><br />Default : Only one contact can be the default. This contact is the main contact for the site, and the one that shows up as default. You can set the default by clicking in the default column.<br /><br />Published : If a contact is Published, then it appears on the site as a choice for the visitor. To Publish or Unpublish one or more Web Links, select the checkbox(es) next to the name of the Contact(s) and click either the 'Publish' or 'Unpublish' icon.<br /><br />Reorder : Click the icons to move the record up or down in the list. The order is used in both the contact manager and on the contact page the Visitor will see.<br /><br />Category : You can assign contacts to different categories.
