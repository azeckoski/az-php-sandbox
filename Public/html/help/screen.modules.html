This can be used as a text box module, image module or even to include&nbsp;customized code.</p><p align="left">Edit: Click the 'Edit' icon to edit or modify the module. Clicking the linked name will also preform this function. This enables you to change attributes of a module like its title, its position, the order in which it appears on the page, access level and whether it is published. From this page you will also be able to change the location the module appears on the Frontend of your site and any parameters that apply to this module.</p><p align="left">Delete:&nbsp;Click the 'Delete' icon to delete/uninstall a module from your system.<br />NOTE: You cannot delete the 'last' module of a particular 'type' on this screen.

Options include All, Varies or None. <br />NOTE: This is not applicable to Administrator modules.<br /><br />ID: This is the ID number for the module item. This is allocated by the Mambo site system when the module instance is saved.<br /><br />Type: This is the type of module. An example is mod_mainmenu which is the 'type' of module used for the User Menu and the Main Menu module instances.<br /><br />Checked Out: This displays the name of the editor/administrator who checked this module out. You will not be able to edit a module item if it is checked out by another editor/administrator. The original editor/administrator must check in his/her items or the system administrator can do this in order for another editor/administrator to edit a module. <br />NOTE: This is blank for modules installed initially with Mambo.<br /><br />At the bottom of the list you may see a pagination feature, which will allow you to navigate to the next set of modules in the list.
