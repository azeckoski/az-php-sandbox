<p><strong>Admin Templates:</strong> Administrator Templates define the lay-out of your Mambo Web site's Backend.</p><p><strong>Alt&nbsp;Tag:</strong> The&nbsp;'alt' attribute, often called the&nbsp;'alt tag' is&nbsp;a text attribute added to&nbsp;the image tag&nbsp;to&nbsp;describe the&nbsp;image contained in&nbsp;the tag. This text is&nbsp;viewable (inside a text box) when one hovers their&nbsp;mouse over an image in the Frontend of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Web&nbsp;site. </p><p><strong>Archive:</strong> Content items can be archived and managed trough the Backend. The Archive Module provides a way of displaying archived items on your Web site.</p><p><strong>Backend:</strong> The 'Backend' is the Mambo Administrator where the site administrator manages the site and it's content.</p><p><strong>Blog:</strong> A Blog style within Mambo is the listing of records in a summary form. Example: It could be by link only, or showing just the introductory text with a link to the complete text. Often the &quot;News&quot; page is written in Blog style.</p><p><strong>Category:</strong>&nbsp; A Category is the name for a collection of items that are related in some way. Example: The category 'Fish' may contain the records 'Herring', 'Haddock' and 'Stickleback'.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Out (an item):</span> When a user edits a file they 'Check it Out'.
