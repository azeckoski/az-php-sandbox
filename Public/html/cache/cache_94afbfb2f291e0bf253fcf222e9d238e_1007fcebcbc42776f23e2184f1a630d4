			<p>"Given the recent discussion involving Sakai, I thought I'd share Whitman College's experience with Sakai. <br />
<br />
Whitman is a small liberal arts college in rural Walla Walla, WA, with 1400 student FTE and an IT department with just 20 staff. Yet, we are in the middle of a successful Sakai pilot. In fact, it looks like we will have a full implementation in fall 2006. <br />
<br />
We had been using Blackboard for the past six years-just the Basic version. When faced with the need to either move to the Enterprise version or to pursue another option about 1-1/2 yr ago, we decided to pursue Sakai. Although we could have experimented/piloted with Sakai for free, we joined Sakai Educational Partners Program (SEPP) for $5,000/yr in November 2004 to show our serious commitment to the project. The membership was not a requirement---in fact, there are many institutions that are using/piloting Sakai without joining SEPP or the Sakai Foundation. Just about every process happens transparently in the public forums.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Although Whitman College seems to be doing fine with one staff member (with good Java knowledge) supporting this project, there are consultants available who assists smaller institutions with Sakai implementation. I know of one consulting firm that currently supports about 50 institutions throughout the US - all small colleges (2,000-6,000 students). Also,consortia of small colleges are finding Sakai to be a strong platform sinceit is not simply a course management system, but rather a framework that supports all levels of collaboration, including inter-institutional.<br />
<br />
While it's too early to discuss TCO for Sakai, I am certain that a fully supported instance of Sakai will be quite a bit below the cost for Blackboard Enterprise.&nbsp; So far, assessments of faculty and students atWhitman are uniformly positive.&nbsp; The Sakai tools are agnostic to size of school and the array of tool choices is growing based on the pedagogical models that we in higher ed need.<br />
<br />
And for that shameless plug---my Sakai staffer, Mike Osterman, and I will be presenting/sharing our experience at the EDUCAUSE Western RegionalConference on April 24-26 in San Francisco. Our presentation is titled "Can Sakai be implemented at a small liberal arts school?" Do join us."<br />

setting up the system."&nbsp; [ <a href="http://internet.newsforge.com/internet/06/02/01/1527252.shtml?tid=13">read the article</a> ]<br />

</div>
<p>The new Sakai Foundation
is pleased to make a series of announcements as the first phase of the
project ends, and over 500 gather in Austin for the fourth Sakai
Conference with the Open Source Portfolio (OSP):</p>
<ul>
<li> The four founding institutions of the Sakai Project
are granting a copyright license to the Sakai Foundation.</li>
<li> The global community of Sakai Partners has elected three new directors to the Sakai Foundation Board.</li>
<li>Sakai 2.1 is released with many new capabilities and new contributors.</li>
<li>Apple Computer, Inc. and Pearson Education are added as Sakai Commercial Affiliates.</li></ul><br />
<strong>
Sakai Conference with OSP</strong><br />
The Austin Conference marks Sakai’s largest gathering yet with over 500
attendees from 144 institutions with 93 member-led sessions.&nbsp; The
conference includes sessions for Sakai implementation, faculty
training, support, development, e-science/e-research, digital
repository integration, and many more topics surrounding developing and
deploying the Sakai software.&nbsp; The Open Source Portfolio joins the
conference with sessions in portfolio thinking, large scale
implementation, development for the 2.1 version of OSP, and much
more.&nbsp; Ira Fuchs of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will present a
keynote address on a “Vision for the Future” from a project sponsor’s
perspective.&nbsp; The conference is at the Austin Hilton Hotel from
7-9 December.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Sakai Founders Grant Copyright License</strong><br />
The University of Michigan, Indiana University, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and Stanford University have each agreed to
grant copyright license to the Sakai Foundation.&nbsp; The Foundation
provides a permanent home for the software and an independent
coordinating organization for the Sakai Community.&nbsp; “This grant
from the four Sakai Project founders gives the Sakai Foundation a clear
lineage of copyright for the Sakai software code,” said Joseph Hardin,
Sakai Project Chairman of the Board.&nbsp; “Like the Apache Foundation,
the Sakai Foundation will use a contributor agreement for all
contributions, and we thought the founding universities should lead by
example in being the first to freely contribute their code.”&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Other Sakai contributors, such as the University of California -
Berkeley, Foothill College, Cambridge University, and many others will
also execute contributor agreements so that the Sakai Software
distribution can have a simple notice of “Copyright the Sakai
Foundation.”<br />
<br />
In addition, Indiana University and the rSmart Group have also granted
copyright licenses for the Open Source Portfolio software code to the
Sakai Foundation.&nbsp; The Open Source Portfolio remains a distinct
community and software project, and it has chosen to work through the
Sakai Foundation for organizational and legal matters. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Community Elects New Board Members</strong><br />
Christopher Coppola (rSmart Group), John Norman (University of
Cambridge, UK), and Charles Severance (University of Michigan) were
elected by the Sakai community in the first election from a field of 16
candidates.&nbsp; These new members replace outgoing Board members Carl
Jacobson (uPortal), Amitava Babi Mitra (MIT) and Jeff Merriman (OKI),
all of whom have made valuable contributions during their tenure. The
bylaws of the Foundation allow all members of the community to run for
the Foundaion board. “This election demonstrates the wisdom of a
diverse Sakai Community,” noted Carl Jacobson, an outgoing board member
who oversaw the election.&nbsp; “The community is over 85% colleges and
universities with the largest representation from North America, yet
this group elected leaders from a company, from England, and the Sakai
Chief Architect (Severance) to the foundation board.&nbsp; Sakai is an
ecosystem of contributors who give with enlightened self interest for a
common good.” <br />
<br />
Lois Brooks (Stanford University), Ian Dolphin (University of Hull,
UK), Mara Hancock (Berkeley), Joseph Hardin (University of Michigan),
Vivian Sinou (Foothill College), Jutta Treviranus (University of
Toronto), and Brad Wheeler (Indiana University) will continue from the
Sakai Project Board to the Sakai Foundation Board.&nbsp; “As the Sakai
founders complete the work of the initial grant, the Sakai community
has sent two clear messages: they want a more open project for
contributions by many and they want continuity.&nbsp; This initial set
of board members for the foundation delivers on both,” said John
Norman, who helped facilitate a governance discussion at the June Sakai
Summer Conference in Baltimore, Maryland.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Sakai 2.1 Software Released 1 December 2005</strong><br />
The 2.1 release of the software marks the fourth release for the
two-year project.&nbsp; It adds the ability to manage multiple sections
of a course, a new API for groups/teams, a Wiki, a pictorial Roster,
and many performance and interface enhancements.&nbsp; Clay Fenlason
(Boston University), who has been piloting Sakai 2.0 this Fall and
worked closely on the 2.1 release, stated that “current users of
release 2.0 will see substantial differences and many refinements
throughout.&nbsp; The Resources Tool has been enhanced, with major
contributions from the OSP community, giving users access to files
across all of their courses and projects from inside any course.”&nbsp;
Many of the tools and new features have already been available and in
full production use at some institutions for months before being
assembled in the 2.1 release package.<br />
<br />
The 2.1 release also marks Sakai’s first release with entire new tools
contributed from non-board member institutions.&nbsp; The growing
maturity of the Sakai Framework is ripe for developers to create and
port quality tools to work with Sakai.&nbsp; “This has been our
smoothest and best release yet,” said Charles Severance. “The community
has learned how to rapidly design, develop, test, and release in the
finest sense of a large open source project.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Sakai Partner Membership Hits 100 Institutions and Companies</strong><br />
One hundred institutions and companies have become Sakai Partners in
the first two years of the Sakai Project.&nbsp; The Sakai software is
free to use, modify, and redistribute under the Educational Community
License, but this formal participation in the community provides great
value in rapidly sharing knowledge, support, and leveraged development.
<p><br />
Charles Sturt University, Australia’s largest distance learning
provider, recently joined the Sakai Foundation and announced support
and deployment for the Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment
software.&nbsp; The University’s Vice Chancellor, Professor Ian
Goulter, said “Sakai is an important initiative because it recognises
the need for a scholarly collaboration environment that is capable of
allowing members of the university community to blur the boundaries
between their various teaching, learning, research and administrative
activities.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Apple Computer, Inc. and Pearson Education Are Newest Sakai Commercial Affiliates</strong><br />
Apple Computer and Pearson Education round out a dozen Sakai Commercial
Affiliates that provide for-fee support, services, or otherwise aid the
Sakai Community and its software.&nbsp; David O'Connor, Pearson Higher
Education's Vice President of Product Development, said "We welcome the
opportunity to join the growing Sakai community by becoming a Sakai
Affiliate.&nbsp; Pearson is dedicated to ensuring that our vast library
of digital courses, in use today by tens of thousands of instructors,
is accessible to the increasing number of institutions that adopt the
Sakai platform."<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
Sakai as a Model for Community Source Projects</strong><br />
In just two years since the Sakai Project was first proposed at
EDUCAUSE 2003, the project has created production-quality software, is
in full deployment and large-scale pilot at dozens of colleges and
universities, and has given higher education a way to meet its software
needs.&nbsp; The Sakai Project and the Open Source Portfolio are both
Community Source projects that were launched with university
investments and generous gifts from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.&nbsp; Community Source is
"community investments for community outcomes in the open source
tradition," said Brad Wheeler, Dean of IT at Indiana University
Bloomington.&nbsp; Many of the investments in community source are
institutional investments from higher ed, and this model fits well with
their needs.&nbsp; <br />

			<p>The Sakai 2.1.0 release is now available.&nbsp; This release adds the<br />
ability to manage sub-sections within course sites, and it has<br />
redesigned several of the Sakai tools to take advantage of such<br />
sections.&nbsp; This sectioning facility represents the first stage of<br />
employing a new API for managing groups of all sorts within Sakai<br />
sites.<br />
<br />
Sakai 2.1.0 is also the first release to include tools developed<br />
within the broader community.&nbsp; Five such tools have already reached<br />
sufficient maturity to be included in the release on a provisional<br />
basis - ranging from a wiki tool to web service endpoints that<br />
leverage the web service capability introduced in Sakai 2.0 - and more<br />
are on track to be considered for future releases.<br />
<br />
The release also includes performance enhancements, UI improvements,<br />
and many other fixes to issues reported for the 2.0 releases.<br />
<br />
The release is provided in demo, source, and binary distributions, and<br />
can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/release">www.sakaiproject.org/release</a><br />
