			<p>The Sakai 2.1.0 release is now available.&nbsp; This release adds the<br />
ability to manage sub-sections within course sites, and it has<br />
redesigned several of the Sakai tools to take advantage of such<br />
sections.&nbsp; This sectioning facility represents the first stage of<br />
employing a new API for managing groups of all sorts within Sakai<br />
sites.<br />
<br />
Sakai 2.1.0 is also the first release to include tools developed<br />
within the broader community.&nbsp; Five such tools have already reached<br />
sufficient maturity to be included in the release on a provisional<br />
basis - ranging from a wiki tool to web service endpoints that<br />
leverage the web service capability introduced in Sakai 2.0 - and more<br />
are on track to be considered for future releases.<br />
<br />
The release also includes performance enhancements, UI improvements,<br />
and many other fixes to issues reported for the 2.0 releases.<br />
<br />
The release is provided in demo, source, and binary distributions, and<br />
can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/release">www.sakaiproject.org/release</a><br />
