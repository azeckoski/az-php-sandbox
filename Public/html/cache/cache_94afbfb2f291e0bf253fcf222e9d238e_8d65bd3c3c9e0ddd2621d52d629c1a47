			<p>The Sakai 2.1.1 release is now available.&nbsp; The spirit behind the 2.1.1 release is to make fixes to the 2.1.0 code base that has been proven in a production environment available to the community. This release offers a total of 71 bug fixes to the software. Of these fixes, 55 were issues unearthed in 2.1.0 since the release was cut and most notably 45% of all fixes applied to the Tests and Quizzes tool. <br />
<br />
 Sites moving from the 2.1.0 to 2.1.1 release will need to perform a small database conversion operation.&nbsp; The details of the steps necessary
to upgrade are specified in the release notes.
<br />
<br />
The release is provided in demo, source, and binary distributions, and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/release/">www.sakaiproject.org/release</a><br />
