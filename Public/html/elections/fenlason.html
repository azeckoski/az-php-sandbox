<div class=interests><br /><br /><strong>Bio:</strong><br /><p>Clay received a B.A. in Physics from Colorado College, having returned to the States for his undergraduate work after being raised in South Korea.  Following the completion of an M.S. in High Energy Astrophysics at Iowa State University he felt compelled to go abroad again, and spent the next 3 years working in community and educational development in southern Africa.  Among his projects were computer literacy programs for primary and secondary school teachers.</p>

<p>He returned to the States - to Boston - to pursue graduate work in Philosophy in 1999.  But after teaching astronomy courses online in his spare time he became captivated by the fields of distance education and instructional technology.</p>

<p>He's been serving as the Associate Director of Academic Computing at Boston University's School of Management for the last two years, and it was through his urging that the School became one of the earlier SEPP partners in March of 2004.</p></div><br />
<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>I think I've left an electronic paper trail - perhaps to a fault - indicating some of what I might bring to the Sakai Board: a demonstrated penchant for frequent and open dialogue, a close familiarity with Sakai on the ground, and a workmanlike readiness to dive into practical problems.  What opinions I wield proceed from a vision of what Sakai needs in order to succeed, and this occasion provides the opportunity for me to try to frame this vision concisely.</p>

<p>Young open source projects are constantly concerned with being attractive to a developer community.  To thrive they need to appeal to a large number of those who care to do significant work with the code.  The net needs to be cast wide, and that means laying claim to a valuable purpose while at the same time rendering the work open and approachable.</p>

<p>The Sakai project has necessarily complicated the calculus by basing itself primarily on a collection of institutional commitments, a layer to some degree incommensurate with the traditional open source mode of production: the collaboration of spontaneously motivated individuals on a large scale.  But in garnering institutional commitments the project has not thus freed itself of the need to harness the drive of individuals who care to do significant work in this space.  Institutional commitments are necessary but not sufficient for the project's success.  Sakai needs to be the sort of project that can satisfy the more conservative institutional requirements while at the same time appealing to the more progressive energies of creative people working in higher ed, in all the flavors in which they come.  This dualism of appeal must find its mirror image in a bicameral governance model.</p>

<p>This is a balance not easily struck, but I see this as the task of the Board in a nutshell.  It must ensure the stability, coherence, and security that institutions value while at the same time championing standards and practices that allow Sakai development to be driven by the passionate work of individuals and niche-development teams in the community.  </p>

<p>Open source veterans have reminded us of the value of humility in working relationships in these sorts of projects, but Sakai needs a humility more pervasive than a character trait.  Sakai needs to be focused on its enabling role as much as what it does in itself, out-of-the-box.  It needs the technological humility to work well with other components and campus systems, and make few assumptions about the way in which it will be used at any given institution.  It needs a greater humility among its developers than is usually called for in traditional open-source middleware - the modesty to defer to priorities of usability and sound pedagogy.  Such modesty also calls for the lowering of expertise barriers to the point where individual faculty and students may also lend their energies to development work.</p>

<p>The Sakai project to date - and for the immediate future - has essentially been focused on meeting an LMS standard.  This is the prerequisite for Sakai getting its foot in the door.  The next stage of Sakai development should see a fuller realization of the larger "CLE" vision, along with a deeper re-examination of how the LMS space currently falls short.  In many ways the most interesting work is yet to come. It's both gratifying and daunting to be considered to help shape a project trying to attempt so much, but I am stirred by the opportunity.</p><br /><br /><br /></div></div>
