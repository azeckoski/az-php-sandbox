<div class=interests><br /><br /><strong>Bio:</strong><br /><p>I lead web communications and internet strategy at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State</a>, Oregon's largest, most diverse, and only urban public university. I work to bring together Portland State's academic, technical and institutional concerns and communities to help students, faculty, and staff collaborate, innovate, do business and tell their stories to wider audiences. Every day I engage with students, teaching and research faculty and administrators at all levels to find strategic communications and technical solutions to diverse institutional needs. Thanks to Portland State's urban location and intensive involvement in community-based learning, I also collaborate with community, business and government constituencies to make richer connections between Portland State and the larger world. In my spare time, I manage hands-on information technology projects on diverse platforms to maintain and develop online systems for public, campus, and educational web communications.</p>

<p>Currently, my focus has been to develop and implement a strategy to integrate Portland State's academics, campus life, university services, and public information online in a mutually reinforcing system, based on a foundation of open and community source technologies. The core of this effort is to establish Sakai/OSP as our enterprise platform to extend and enhance all our teaching and learning activities. Complimenting this core strategy are two related efforts, both also built on open/community source technologies. First, to build a comprehensive web portal to extend our campus community online and provide a common online environment for all university services. And second, to engage our local, regional, national and worldwide communities through vibrant, integrated online content delivered via an enterprise content management system.</p>

<p>Before joining Portland State, I was webmaster for OMSI, the Oregon Museum of Science & Industry, one of the world's premier public science education institutions and probably the funnest place to work ever. I have helped found, directed and led technology strategies for several educational and nonprofit organizations in diverse fields, including genetics science and policy, social services for people with AIDS, and media studies. My other work includes extensive academic, educational, non-profit, and business consulting experience. For more information, see my resume (<a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~angell/resume.html">http://web.pdx.edu/~angell/resume.html</a>).</p>

<p>I hold an MA and am ABD for a PhD from Brown University, where my focus is on the social, economic and cultural roles of film, television and new media technologies. I also hold a BA in Latin American History from Columbia University. For more information, see my curriculum vitae (<a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~angell/cv.html">http://web.pdx.edu/~angell/cv.html</a>).</p>

<p>I was raised by wolves in rural Colorado and currently live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Heather, and two daughters Lucy (5) and Twyla (1). Don't tell anyone, but the coffee, bread, cheese, beer, and wine in Portland are the best this side of Europe, and it actually doesn't rain as much as they say.</p></div><br />
<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>If given the honor to serve on the Board, I would strive to help guide Sakai and its foundation by focusing on three general areas:</p>

<p>1) Represent the viewpoint of the large majority of medium-sized and smaller educational institutions whose technology needs and resources sometimes align with and sometimes differ from those of large, research universities.</p>

<p>2) Enhance and extend Sakai's integration with other essential technologies, including complimentary open/community source systems like Open Source Portfolio and uPortal, but also commercial applications and general technology standards.</p>

<p>3) Foster the overall Sakai and community source ecosystem to ensure we can sustain our work and continue to create an increasingly rich environment to support Sakai and related projects and practices.</p>

<p>My work at Portland State puts me in a unique position to represent institutions of higher learning. Located somewhere between the flagship universities that have had the vision and resources to provide the founding impetus for Sakai, and the large majority of smaller colleges and universities worldwide that struggle to meet basic information technology needs, Portland State is laying out plans to transform our educational enterprise by integrating all of our online efforts on an open/community source technology platform with Sakai/OSP at its center.</p>

<p>Some special circumstances at Portland State make our transformation possible:</p>

<p>1) Portland State's innovative undergraduate general education program, University Studies, is in its twelfth year of interdisciplinary, portfolio-based instruction. Unlike many institutions that must demonstrate the need for an integrated, collaborative learning environment, Portland State looks to Sakai/OSP to enhance and extend already institutionalized teaching and learning practices. The community source model will enable Portland State to help shape the tools that will allow us to integrate collaborative learning and portfolio thinking throughout the institution.</p>

<p>2) Portland State has the good fortune to be located in the Northwest's "silicon forest," which has grown to become a center of gravity in open source technology efforts. The university takes advantage of its location by incorporating open source into curriculum and research, as well as by looking to open source technology to support its administrative systems. As a sign of our growing momentum for open source, a recent grant from Google enables Portland State to partner with OSU's Open Source Lab to coordinate open source computer science course work throughout the Oregon university system and offer student internships in open source.</p>

<p>3) Portland State's intensive engagement in community-based learning and our special status as the most accessible public university in Oregon lead us to try to find new ways to extend teaching and learning beyond our campus in partnership with community organizations, business, community colleges, and local K-12 schools. We look to Sakai/OSP to provide a collaborative learning environment that also enables students and faculty to reflect on their work systematically across time and create customized presentations for different purposes and audiences.</p>

<p>4) Portland State's dramatic growth in a time of decreasing funding for public education and our prime downtown location have led us to develop a highly entrepreneurial mindset to help meet the growing demands for university services outside normal business hours and the campus compound. We see the integration of systems for teaching, learning, research, campus community, online transactions and public information on open source platforms as the best solution to enable Portland State to continue to increase the quality of our academic endeavors and maintain our commitment to accessible education.</p>

<p>While other institutions may not have all these opportunities and challenges, most institutions are faced with at least some of them as we all deal with radical changes in educational realities and practices. If elected to the Sakai Board, I would work to translate experience gained from Portland State's ambitious plans to help Sakai become the obvious choice for all types of institutions looking to make similar transformations to match their own special circumstances.</p>
