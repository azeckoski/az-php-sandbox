<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>Vision Statement on Learning and Collaborative Tools</p>

<p>Ken Spelke, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</p>

<p>I feel strongly that all tools being developed should meet the pedagogical soundness test:  &#8220;What teaching / learning challenges will a particular proposed tool help solve?&#8221;  I believe we should never develop a product or a process just because &#8220;it&#8217;s cool,&#8221; but because it has real potential to advance education in a specific and tangible way &#8211; and equally important &#8211; that it will be superior in fit and function to commercial or other open source tools already available.</p>

<p>I believe in a rich mix of collaborative tools from many sources.  There are good commercial products currently available which have good features and perform reliably &#8211; I think we have enough to do without reinventing wheels.  I would like to see faculty, students, and administrators able to comfortably and knowledgeably choose from a wide variety of open source and commercial products so that each course or project benefits from access to the &#8220;best of the best.&#8221;  I do not adhere to the philosophy of &#8220;it&#8217;s only good if it&#8217;s invented here.&#8221;  That said, I think a major challenge for the Sakai Foundation will be to ensure interoperability of Sakai tools with other open source and commercial products, across all major computing platforms, and with the major institutional administrative enterprise systems like Banner, PeopleSoft, and others.</p>

<p>Another area that I am passionate about is a commitment to ensuring that the tools our community develops are accessible and functional for disabled users.  This is a digital divide issue that the educational community must actively and relentlessly seek to overcome.</p>

<p>In terms of leadership style, I always try to be as inclusive as possible, since good decision-making requires thorough, accurate, and diverse input.  Consensus building is important in any organization, but I think particularly so in a community like Sakai.  Often, we face not the question of &#8220;what is best,&#8221; but what is appropriate within a particular context, what is possible to achieve within limitations of time and available resources, and which investments in time and energy have the greatest potential to benefit significant numbers of Sakai stakeholders.  I also believe, to borrow from the terminology of social network analysis, in the great value of brokers and bridges &#8211; individuals who try to see common areas of interest and effort, identify potentially efficacious partnerships, and then do all possible to create environments which foster and support them.  In all of the professional organizations I actively participate in, I have always taken great pleasure in identifying partnership potentials and working to facilitate multi-state, multi-institutional initiatives.  </p>

<p>Finally, as a parent of two new college freshmen, I feel a direct and deep personal interest in doing all possible to help create an educational environment which truly encourages and enhances learning, and provides the infrastructure for developing 21st century technological competencies for our instructors and our students.  This is about empowerment&#8230;it is essential for ensuring the lifelong and just-in-time learning skills which will undoubtedly create opportunities for advancement and improved quality of life for people in all societies and across all nations. </p>
