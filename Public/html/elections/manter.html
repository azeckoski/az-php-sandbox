<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>The Sakai Foundation represents an important step in advancing the evolution of the Sakai Project and other related open source initiatives that will further the development and use of open source software within the higher education community.  Through proper support and guidance from the Sakai Foundation, institutional members will play a major role in shaping and effecting the proliferation of open source in higher education and, ultimately, in the commercial marketplace.</p>

<p>With more than 20-years in the high technology industry, I bring a deep understanding of what is required to build an effective eco-system and deliver a successful product to the marketplace supported by a comprehensive business and marketing plan.  Additionally, I offer solid experience working with major vendors, press and analysts that combined with strong business acumen will deliver tremendous value as a member of the Sakai Foundation Board.  Over the past 10-years I have held key management and leadership positions both professionally and in giving back to the community through volunteer efforts to important organizations like NFTE (National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurs).  I, therefore, also bring solid leadership skills with a successful track record in promoting close collaboration across organizations and driving required change.</p>

<p>If elected, I look forward to working diligently with the other board directors and applying my leadership skills, vast industry experience and strong business acumen to achieving the goals established by the Sakai Foundation.</p><br /><br /><br /></div></div>
