			<p>In a recent NewsForge article, author Bruce Byfield offers a review of the <a href="http://www.osportfolio.org/%20target=blank">Open Source Portfolio Iniative</a> and calls it<font size="-1"> "one of the best-designed content management system for education
that I have seen. Its attention to the user interface means both
convenience and high scalability for end users, and the integration
with SAKAI connects portfolios to other aspects of online learning.
These advantages place OSP far ahead of its competitors, including
commercial proprietary software such as WebCT. Although some might disagree, I recommend it strongly to educators, as long as they have some
computer competence already and technical help to assist them in
setting up the system."&nbsp; [ <a href="http://internet.newsforge.com/internet/06/02/01/1527252.shtml?tid=13">read the article</a> ]<br />
