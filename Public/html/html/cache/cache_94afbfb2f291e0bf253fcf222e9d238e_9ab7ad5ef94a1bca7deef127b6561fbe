			<p>"Given the recent discussion involving Sakai, I thought I'd share Whitman College's experience with Sakai. <br />
<br />
Whitman is a small liberal arts college in rural Walla Walla, WA, with 1400 student FTE and an IT department with just 20 staff. Yet, we are in the middle of a successful Sakai pilot. In fact, it looks like we will have a full implementation in fall 2006. <br />
<br />
We had been using Blackboard for the past six years-just the Basic version. When faced with the need to either move to the Enterprise version or to pursue another option about 1-1/2 yr ago, we decided to pursue Sakai. Although we could have experimented/piloted with Sakai for free, we joined Sakai Educational Partners Program (SEPP) for $5,000/yr in November 2004 to show our serious commitment to the project. The membership was not a requirement---in fact, there are many institutions that are using/piloting Sakai without joining SEPP or the Sakai Foundation. Just about every process happens transparently in the public forums.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Although Whitman College seems to be doing fine with one staff member (with good Java knowledge) supporting this project, there are consultants available who assists smaller institutions with Sakai implementation. I know of one consulting firm that currently supports about 50 institutions throughout the US - all small colleges (2,000-6,000 students). Also,consortia of small colleges are finding Sakai to be a strong platform sinceit is not simply a course management system, but rather a framework that supports all levels of collaboration, including inter-institutional.<br />
<br />
While it's too early to discuss TCO for Sakai, I am certain that a fully supported instance of Sakai will be quite a bit below the cost for Blackboard Enterprise.&nbsp; So far, assessments of faculty and students atWhitman are uniformly positive.&nbsp; The Sakai tools are agnostic to size of school and the array of tool choices is growing based on the pedagogical models that we in higher ed need.<br />
<br />
And for that shameless plug---my Sakai staffer, Mike Osterman, and I will be presenting/sharing our experience at the EDUCAUSE Western RegionalConference on April 24-26 in San Francisco. Our presentation is titled "Can Sakai be implemented at a small liberal arts school?" Do join us."<br />
