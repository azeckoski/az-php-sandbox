<h1>Mambot Manager</h1>

<p>Draft version<hr /><br />Mambots are essentially code snippets which when called via various parameters either activate a program, script or perform a specific function. They can be as simple as a function which replaces typed text with code (such as typing to display an image in a content item) to full fledged third party libraries such as WYSIWYG editors or other programs.</p><p>Publish: Check the box to the left of the Mambot you wish to use, and click the &quot;Publish&quot; icon to publish the Mambot.</p><p>Unpublish: Check the box to the left of the Mambot and then click the &quot;Unpublish&quot; icon to unpublish your Mambot.</p><p>New:&nbsp; Click the &quot;New&quot; icon to create a new Mambot. Then fill in the fields listed.</p><p>Edit: Check the box next to the Mambot you wish to edit, and then click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon. Or, you can simply click on the Linked Title of the Mambot you wish to edit. When you are within the screen for the Mambot you wish to edit, change the settings as desired, then click the &quot;Save&quot; icon. To quit editing and drop all changes you have made to your Mambot, simply click the &quot;Cancel&quot; icon and you will be returned to your previous screen.</p><p>Delete: To &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Uninstall&quot; a Mambot, simply check the box next to the Mambot you would like to delete and then click the &quot;Delete&quot; icon</p><p>WARNING: This cannot be undone. Deleted Mambots cannot be restored as a &quot;Menu Item&quot; or &quot;Content Item&quot; can. If you have deleted a Mambot and you wish to use that Mambot again, you must Re-Install the Mambot. </p><p>NOTE: Mambots essential to core operations cannot be deleted.</p>
