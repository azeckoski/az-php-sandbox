The template will be deleted from the file system.<br />&nbsp;<br />When you select a template to assign, you will be presented with a list of pages to choose from. You can select multiple pages from the menu and assign them to a template. When assigned, the template will appear when a user clicks these pages. This will override the default template. The &quot;Template Manager&quot; also allows you to choose the default template (using the &quot;Default&quot; icon) which will appear on all pages for which specific assignments has not been made. <br />NOTE: Both the assigned and the default template will get overridden by the Template Chooser module in the Frontend, if used.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Administrator Templates can be choosen by clicking the &quot;Default&quot; icon. Administrator Templates are not assignable to any pages.
