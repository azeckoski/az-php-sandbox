Click on the name of this module to edit it. In the edit form, change the title of the menu (eg, to &quot;Privacy Menu&quot;) and change the Menu Type in the Parameters group (eg, &quot;privacy&quot;). Click the Save icon when you are finished.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now, hover over Menus and you should see that in the Menus dropdown you have a new menu called &quot;Privacy Menu&quot;. You may repeat this procedure as many times as you like. There is no limit to the number of menus that you can have and to which menu items they are associated with.<br />&nbsp;
