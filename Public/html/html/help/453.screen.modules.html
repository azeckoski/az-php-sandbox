<h1>Module Manager</h1>
<p align="left">Modules are modular elements used to display information items or interactive features throughout a Mambo Site. The main characteristic is to be positioned off content in pre-established positions ruled by the corresponding template (Front-end or Back-end templates for Site and Administrator areas respectively). </p><p align="left">Examples of modules are Menus, Login and Search forms. Simple HTML Modules can be created directly from the Module Manager. In more complicated cases, they will have to be installed. There are hundreds of modules already programmed for Mambo, written by various Mambo community members.&nbsp; You will find them on the Mambo projects site, <a href="http://mamboforge.net/"><font color="#77689d" size="1">mamboforge.net</font></a>. They are free and available for download.</p><p align="left">The <strong>Module Manager</strong> displays the installed modules.&nbsp; You can manage them by clicking on the appropriate icon in the Tool Bar.</p><h3 align="left"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Toolbar Icons</span></h3><p align="left"><span ><strong>Publish:</strong> Click on the 'Publish' icon to publish your modules on the Front-end of your Web site.</span><br  /><br  /><span ><strong>Unpublish:</strong> Click on the 'Unpublish' icon to unpublish your modules on the Front-end of your Web site.</span></p><p  align="left"><strong>Copy:</strong> Click on the 'Copy' icon to make a copy of the selected module. This enables it to be displayed in more than one place on the Front-end of your Web site. A new version is created with the name 'Copy of (the name of the module you copied)'. You can rename it.<br /><br /><strong>New:</strong> Click on the &quot;New&quot; icon to create a custom module with a &quot;User&quot; type.&nbsp; This is a very useful module which may be used to display Content (this content is not related to Sections, Categories or Static Content Items) or an&nbsp; RSS Feed. It can be used as a text box, image module or even to include&nbsp;customized code.</p><p  align="left"><strong>Edit:</strong> Click on the 'Edit' icon to edit or modify the module. Clicking the linked name will also perform this function. This enables you to change the attributes of a module like it's title, it's position, the order in which it appears on the page, access level and whether it is published or not. From this page you will also be able to change the location the module appears on the Front-end of your site and any parameters that apply to the module.</p><p  align="left"><span ><strong>Delete:</strong>&nbsp;Click on the 'Delete' icon to delete/uninstall a module from your system.</span><br  /><span ><strong>NOTE:</strong> You cannot delete the 'last' module of a particular 'type' on this screen. If you want to delete a specific type of module, go to the Install/Uninstall screen as explained above.</span><br  /><br  /><span ><strong>Help:</strong> Click on the 'Help' icon to view the help screen&nbsp;for this page.</span></p><h3  align="left"><span ></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Column Descriptions</span></h3><p  align="left"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span><span ><strong>Check Box/Padlock:</strong> Click this to select the module. A padlock icon will replace the Check Box if&nbsp;the item is&nbsp;checked-out. This means the module is unavailable to other managers. If you have checked-out the item, click the name to go to the Edit screen.&nbsp; You can either click the Save or the Cancel icon to check back in the module.&nbsp; If this module has been checked out by another manager/administrator, please contact the administrator of your site for him/her to Check-in the&nbsp;module.&nbsp;</span></p><p  align="left"><span ><strong>Module Name:</strong> This is the title of the module. It is editable and&nbsp;will be displayed on the Front-end of your Web site if you choose so.&nbsp; </span></p><p  align="left"><span ><strong>Published:</strong> This tells you if the module contents will show on the Front-end of your Web site. Click the 'blue' arrow icon or 'red' cross to toggle the status.</span><br  /><br  /><span ><strong>Reorder:</strong> This column allows you to change the relevant order that the modules display on the Front-end of your Web page(s). Click the 'up' or 'down' arrows to increase or decrease the module order by one position.</span></p><p  align="left"><strong>Order :</strong> This shows the order of the modules as displayed in the Front-end of your site.<br />To modify this order, type in the number that you would like to have them presented.&nbsp; Then, click on the ‘Save Order’ icon next to the Column Heading ‘Order’.</p><p  align="left"><strong>Access:</strong> This shows who can see the modules on the Front-end of a Web page. Clicking the link will toggle through Public/Registered/Special.<br /><br /><strong>Position:</strong> This shows which template positions the module will display in. Some common Template positions are - User1, Left, Right, and Top. <br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can only assign the module position to one that is already coded into your template<br /><br /><strong>Pages:</strong> This shows which pages the module will display on. Options include All, Varies or None.<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not applicable to Administrator modules. Click on the Edit icon in the Toolbar to edit this.<br /><br /><strong>ID:</strong> This is the ID number for the module item. This is allocated by the Mambo site system when the module instance is saved.<br /><br /><strong>Type:</strong> This is the type of module. An example is mod_mainmenu which is the 'type' of module used for the User Menu and the Main Menu module instances.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the bottom of the list you may see a pagination feature, which will allow you to navigate to the next set of modules in the list. You can also set the number of modules displayed on a page by selecting the number in the drop down box at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Filtering functions are available at the top-right of the list. To filter the displayed modules by Position and module type, select from the Select Position and/or Select Type drop down menu. You can refine your filter by typing in the keyword that you wish to filter in the field box. </body>
