<h1>What's New in Version 4.5.2</h1>

counter measure for a XSS problem found in the PHP globals variable.
<h1>Administrator Interface</h1><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Important</span>: Whenever you enter most &quot;edit&quot; screens, that is, a screen where there is a &quot;Save&quot; button, the menubar will be hidden from view.&nbsp; This is a safety measure to ensure that a user does not simply navigate to another screen without either saving or cancelling, leaving the item &quot;checked out&quot;.<br /><h1>Templates</h1>

<p>The mosreadDirectory function is now able to recursively look in sub directories.</p>


<p>The database class supports two new methods. <code>Quote</code> returns an escaped string wrapped in single quotes.
<code>loadAssocList</code> returns a list of table rows as associative arrays.<br /></p><p><code>mosLoadModules</code> has a new '-3' style. &nbsp;This parameter renders a module using html definition list tags that allow greater flexibility for template designers. &nbsp;Techniques such as css rounded corners around a module is at last possible with this new option.</p>


<h2>Admin Toolbars</h2>


<p>You can now include help files with your components, for example, in a <code>/help</code> directory under the
component directory. In addition, you may write help file in html as well as docbook example. To use these new
features, write the full relative path as the first argument of the mosMenubar help method. Specify <code>true</code>
as the second (optional) argument. This tells Mambo to look in the component's directory first.</p>
