<h1>What's New in Version 4.5.3</h1>
Version 4.5.3 represents a milestone for the 4.5.x series of Mambo. Now Mambo is even more secure and is OSI Certified Open Source Software.

<h1>Administrator Interface</h1>
The administrator's interface now features two options:<br />
1) Simple Interface: When selected, this option provides a less complicated interface and is primarily intended to serve the needs of new users or those with minimal content configuration needs, and<br />
2) Advanced Interface: This is the default administration interface option and is consistent with the version 4.5.2 admin screens. This interface is designed with the needs of more advanced users and webmasters in mind, and presents the widest range of configuration flexibility.

<h1>Templates</h1>
New template samples have been added to this release.

<h1>Help System Changes</h1>
New help screens have been added and the help system has been expanded to help decrease inaccuracies in the delivery of help content.<br />
