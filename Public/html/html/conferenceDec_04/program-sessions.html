One current area of interest, for example, is the development of tools capable of federated searching of disparate catalogs and repositories. Other possibilities might entail refactoring the delivery of current library services to leverage existing tools. An example of this would be to expose electronic reserves lists using RSS, taking advantage of the Sakai News tool. These examples just scratch the surface.

Basic tools are important because users expect them and user expectations must be satisfied to have widespread adoption of Sakai.&nbsp; But now as the basic tools are almost ready, we must think about what other functionality is needed to support learning; what other tools are needed for a next generation Collaboration Learning Environment. We in the Sakai Project can take several approaches to influence web-supported teaching and learning. This presentation will discuss some of the possibilities.</p>        <div><strong>Charles Kerns, </strong>Stanford University</div>      </div>      <div class="line"> &nbsp;</div>      <div>        <p><strong>Friday, Dec. 10th 9:30-10:15 a.m. <br>          <span class="style1">Sakai Architecture Update II</span></strong></p>        <p>This talk will dedicate more to time to the discussion of the Architecture I topics.</p>        <p>Sakai Architecture Update I</p>        <p>This talk will describe the Sakai Architecture as describes in the Sakai Java Framework Document.&nbsp; We will highlight changes in the framework and architecture since the previous SEPP meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will describe the new changes for the 1.5 release both from a tool and framework&nbsp; Other topics include:&nbsp; IMS Tool Interoperability effort, iFrame integration, WSRP plans and portal integration plans.&nbsp; In addition there will be some discussion of Framework I (legacy) and Framework II issues.&nbsp; The talk will also include a discussion regarding the general direction for the 2.0 release, possible features, and framework changes.</p>        <div><strong>Charles Severance</strong>, University of Michigan</div>      </div>      <div class="line"> &nbsp;</div>      <div>        <p><strong>Friday, Dec. 10th 9:30-10:15 a.m. <br>          <span class="style1">Sakai Tools Update II</span></strong></p>        <p>During this session, the TTeam will review hot topics from the conference, action items related to the next 6-12 months of the project and open discussion in an interactive forum with the audience.&nbsp; Additional information on Samigo and Grade book may also be provided during this session as time permits.&nbsp;</p>        <div><strong>Rob Lowden, </strong>University of Indiana</div>      </div>      <div class="line"> &nbsp;</div>      <div>        <p><strong>Friday, Dec. 10th 9:30-10:15 a.m. <br>          <span class="style1">DG Content - eLearning and Accessibility</span></strong></p>        <p>What does &quot;accessibility&quot; mean in an eLearning context?
