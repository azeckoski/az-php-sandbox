<div class=interests><br /><br /><strong>Bio:</strong><br /><p>Charles Hedrick is currently University Director of Instructional and Research Technology and Chief Technology Officer at Rutgers University. He has been in IT management since 1978, having managed departmental facilities for the computer science department, and central IT facilities for the Rutgers New Brunswick campus.</p>

<p>He has a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie-Mellon University, and served as a faculty member for the first 4 years of his career. From his graduate student and faculty days, he has refereed publications in physics, economics, and computer science.</p>

<p>Dr. Hedrick has been involved in software development and implementation for most of his career, having developed several compilers for the DEC-20 computer, and overseen the development of networking and server architecture at Rutgers. He currently operates central facilities such as LDAP and a campus-wide mail and calendar system. In addition, his area is responsible for academic infrastructure such as WebCT and Sakai. He has contributed several features and bug fixes to Sakai, and done tuning for Sakai with MySQL and 64-bit Java.</p>

<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>I'm not sure I have a "platform." I can say what we're interested in doing with Sakai at Rutgers. We see it as equally important for support of instruction, research, and general community use. In all cases, we're looking at Sakai as a way to put together support resources: links to the Library, video tools, and collaboration tools such as wikis and blogs, etc.</p>

<p>We've had some rocky experiences with courses that need things that aren't quite there yet. However many of our faculty see the long-term advantage of a system that is under the control of the higher ed community.</p>

<p>In many ways I think Sakai could be the most critical central IT project we have. We've spent $100 M on the network over the last few years. Now people want to know what they're going to get out of it. I believe the things Sakai is currently looking at, and the other tools that can reasonably be integrated with it, are the things that are likely to make the most difference to how our faculty, staff and students operate: collaboration and access to academic resources.</p>

<p>The Sakai community is now at a critical point. We have a product that shows promise, and is usable for many applications. But we are somewhat like a startup that has had initial success, but now has to grow the company. That's a dangerous phase, in which many companies fail. Among the challenges we face are</p>

<p> * putting together sufficient development resources</p>
<p> * setting standards for integration of tools</p>

<p> * making architectural decisions that will allow future development in a way that doesn't turn the system into a collection of kludges</p>
<p> * making tradeoffs between features and implementation quality</p>

<p>There's a good deal of functionality that has to be there. But we also know that the success of a system often depends as much on integration and support quality as features. The fact that users can easily create sites and add members has made more supporters for Sakai at Rutgers than we've lost through all the insufficiencies of the discussion groups and tests.</p>

<p>There's no neat answers to any of these issues, because they all involve balancing considerations where neither extreme is tenable. So about all I can say is that this is a business I've been in one way or another since 1978.</p>

<p>There are however one or two issues where I think I need to speak frankly. Many people have the perception that Sakai started more as an IT project than an instructional project. In that respect it has been contrasted with Moodle, where faculty needs have clearly taken priority. Both considerations have to be there. We need a system that is scalable, and that will survive several decades of development without turning into mush. However we need to hear more about pedagogical (and research) needs, and about the UI. If people can't use a feature, it's just as bad as if the feature doesn't work -- our users don't see any difference. We need to find a way to bring pedagogical and UI needs into our processes, without compromising the architectural work.</p>
