<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>The Sakai project is having major success in creating a de-facto standard for Collaborative Learning Environments. It has also raised interest as a tool for research and as a means to bridge research and education. I believe this is a critical point at which Sakai needs to balance a continuing focus on education with a more coherent outreach to researchers and to cyberinfrastructure developers. Why?</p>
<p>There have been a number of pilot projects to develop research environments using Sakai and its precursors (e.g. CHEF), several of which I’ve been involved with as architect, advisor, or reviewer, that I think have helped the Sakai team to refine aspects of the Sakai architecture to improve its robustness and flexibility. Given the energy within NSF and other agencies for the development of cyberinfrastructure, and the breadth of the overall cyberinfrastructure vision, I think Sakai has an opportunity for increased leverage of the expertise and resources being applied to the development of cyberinfrastructure by playing a coordinating role in both the research and education communities. </p>
<p>The interest in Sakai from the research community is real. The concepts of a framework to allow groups to manage their activity and context, and of building tools to be aware of and contribute to that shared group context are increasingly seen as a core requirement in supporting complex research initiatives. Sakai can provide a robust foundation in this area and, if the development of research-oriented tools can be coordinated in the way the Sakai project has coordinated the development of educational tools, Sakai could quickly have a wide impact in the research community.</p>
<p>A common platform for research and education collaborations could lower the barriers to adoption of cyberinfrastructure and could enable revolutionary combinations of research and education activities. Sakai has the opportunity to prevent balkanization of the collaboration and tool integration layer of cyberinfrastructure and to enable new synergies that bring authentic research activities into the classroom and enhance the life-long learning opportunities in research settings. Over the past decade there have been some very exciting projects using collaboratory and grid technologies in this manner; a shared platform could make such an integrated approach ubiquitous. </p>
<p>The time is right for a more coordinated outreach to the research community. Creating an infrastructure requires consideration of architecture and scalability and, as we move now from pilot projects to persistent cyberinfrastructure, there are opportunities. I believe that such outreach can be managed without disrupting Sakai’s progress in serving the needs of the education community; the additional energy and expertise that would be brought to the Sakai platform will more than justify the investment in outreach.</p>
<p>I believe I can help the Sakai Foundation in engaging the research cyberinfrastructure community while maintaining emphasis on serving needs in education. I have worked on a number of multi-institution development and standardization projects and have an understanding of how to build a productive consensus between stakeholders. In my work over the past decade, I have successfully transitioned projects from a purely research and development mode to a production mode where usability and maintainability are the drivers. In my role as acting Associate Director of Cyberenvironments at NCSA, I will be deeply engaged in national and international efforts to coordinate cyberinfrastructure development, and will be working to assure that cyberinfrastructure is effective in providing research and education value and, that it can support innovation in learning and research methodologies. While I have not been involved in the formal Sakai community, I have collaborated with many of its members, am familiar with the Sakai framework, and am very interested in helping Sakai, and cyberinfrastructure as a whole, reach their full potential. </p>
