<div class=interests><br /><br /><strong>Bio:</strong><br /><p>Biography Ð A. Harry Williams</p>
<p>I have been employed in information technology in higher education for over 25 years.  I have a board experience in many areas, from applications programming, systems administration, networking and desktop computing support.</p>

<p>I have experience working in campus-wide groups having been the technical lead in the development of the campus-wide Information Security Policy.  I currently led the IT Security Working group and Disaster Recovery team.</p>

<p>I currently work with a talented staff of 26 people including systems programmers for large IBM systems, AIX and Linux; student desktop support (ResNet), network security, research services (support grant and research computing), and client services (help desk, desktop support and computer operations) who do a great job of making me look good to my boss.  ResNet is now assisting all students with connecting to the campus network, providing training on email, web services available to students, spyware and virus management, identity theft and other student needs.  ResNet works closely with core Information and Computer Literacy course</p>

<p>Working closely with our School of Computer Science, we have helped build an intercollegiate computing grid with three other schools and we help support a state-supported College Applied Research and Technology (CART) center for collaborative and on-demand computing.</p>

<p>My team has been the lead group involved with several joint projects with IBM, including Digital Library, Linux Research, z/OS Knowledge Center, Grid Computing/Globus Toolkit, eUtility/Computing on demand, Small Group Multicast.</p>

<p>I have been involved with planning, coordinating and publicizing the port of Linux to the IBM S/390 or zSeries architecture, and developed the concept of sharing of resources for Linux for zSeries to build on-demand environment for faculty and students.  We successfully established Linux images on zSeries and on Intel platforms for lab environments, supporting over 700 virtual Linux servers for students in course work.  Today we also run the Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) system used for testing and porting to the IBM zSeries platform.</p>

<p>I have led a team that implemented and supported online integrated library system, including digital library with multimedia for both the college and in collaboration with the FDR Presidential Library.</p>

<p>While my participation in Sakai has been limited to date, I have been active in several computer user groups and other volunteer organizations so I have some experience working with and motivating diverse groups of people, maintaining good communication and an open mind.  My experiences have exposed me to a wide variety of responsibilities including program committee and committee chair, program development, technical coordination, software requirement management and development and software exchange, many of the same issues on the road ahead.</p>

<p>Finally, I have an MBA in Human Resources, an MS in Computer and Information Science, and a BA in Computer Mathematics</p>

<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>Platform Statement Ð A. Harry Williams</p>
<p>The Sakai Project is at a crossroads.  The operating model is changing, and it is a critical time in the life of the project.  Many good things have come out of the Sakai Project and its predecessors, and the history and goodwill must not be lost or squandered.  The things that it has done well, the openness and collaboration must be understood, acknowledged, valued and continuously nurtured.  We must build upon that tradition as we move forward into the future and open new avenues</p>

<p>It is important to maintain and enhance the open nature of both the technical process and management of the Sakai Foundation.</p>

<p>There are four hurdles on the road ahead for The Sakai Foundation.  We must seek additional funding sources; increase our academic base; continue to improve communication; and foster cooperative work with corporations.</p>

<p>Additional sources of funding will be required to continue to move forward.  Some of these can come from a broader membership base, but we will need to continue to look for other possibilities such as grants and corporate collaboration and sponsorship</p>

<p>Sakai has a very diverse membership base, including many international members.  International members are extremely important as they bring in varied character sets, cultural differences, legal differences and different academic models.  At the same time, in the US, Sakai needs to move to include a more diverse set of academic institutions.  Twelve of the largest 20 academic institutions in the US are members, with over 50% of the members having a Carnegie classification of Doctoral/Research when less than 7% of the entire US schools are Doctoral/Research.  Most of the largest institutions in the US are already involved in one manner or another with Sakai.  Sakai should continue to focus on public and private-non-profit schools, but it must find ways to penetrate the Masters Level I (comprehensive) and Associates Level institutions market.  We need to find ways to encourage new members, make it easier for new members to try Sakai software, and make them feel more welcome.  The current method of providing and sharing information is overwhelming and intimidating.  I will work to increase the membership base, while making it easier for new members to become active participants in Sakai.</p>

<p>Any collaborative project demands high levels of communication among and between its participants.  Sakai has been successful in maintaining a high level of communication, but we must ensure that our communication efforts continue to increase.  Openness and transparency at the board level are important, as are communication at all levels of the organization.  I will strive to maintain and improve such communication.  I will make myself available, as needed, to listen openly and honestly to all.  I value the opinions of all.</p>

<p>We must foster a sense of cooperation with corporations, both developers of software and systems with which we must interface and with developers of infrastructure like Oracle and IBM.  At the same time, we must encourage development of alternative solutions so that we are not dependent on single source vendors.</p>

<p>Finally, I will work collegially with the existing board, be representative of the Sakai Foundation and fully support the board in all decisions out of the boardroom.  I thank you for your consideration, as it would be an honor to serve the Sakai Foundation.</p>
