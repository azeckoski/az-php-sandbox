<div class=interests><br /><br /><strong>Bio:</strong><br /><p>Professional Summary:  Chuck Powell</p>

<p>Chuck is the Senior Director for Academic Media & Technology at Yale University (www.yale.edu/amt).  Academic Media & Technology, with a staff of approximately 90 professionals and 200 students, provides IT and media services and solutions to the Yale community in the support of teaching, learning, and research.  Chuck has served Yale in this capacity since 2002.  Previously Chuck served as the Director of Workstation Support Services (www.yale.edu/wss) within ITS.</p>

<p>Yale is currently running Sakai in production on campus under the name Classes*V2 (classesv2.yale.edu).  Yale is committed to replacing their homegrown CMS with Sakai by 2007.  This semester alone over 200 courses at Yale have moved over to the new system. </p>

<p>Chuck has a Bachelor of Science from the United States Military Academy at West Point and a Masters of Science (all but dissertation) from the University of Washington in Organizational Psychology.  He has seven years of experience as a faculty member to his credit, teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses in both Psychology and Research Methods.</p>

<p>Chuck has been an engaged member of the Sakai Educational Partners Program since its inception and has served both as a Discussion Group Lead (for the Strategy and Advocacy DG) and a member of the team that planned the SEPP Conference in Baltimore.  Chuck has also presented and written on the topic in numerous forums including a June 2005, Chronicle of Higher Education article entitled, "Course Management Systems: It's a New World". </p>

<div class=interests><strong>Platform:</strong><br /><p>Platform Statement Ð Chuck Powell</p>

<p>First and foremost I'd like to thank you for the respect and honor that a nomination to the Board conveys.  Second, it's not clear to me that I am the best candidate given the professional credentials of others and my own local commitments to "my day job" which includes getting Sakai fully in place at Yale.</p>

<p>If elected to the board you can count on me to try and forward the following agenda items for the community.</p>

<p>Continued advancement of Sakai as the best possible framework and environment for collaboration and course management in higher education.  I do not believe that Sakai is "simply" an Open Source Course Management System with feature by feature competition and comparison as its future.  I believe that Sakai represents a new and better paradigm with it's commitment to the availability of the source code, focus on a select community or higher education institutions and intent to be a framework for many locally developed tools and needs rather than a delimited set of features.</p>

<p>The original founding institutions have given the community a great start towards both a core of code and a fledgling community.  I believe the way to continue to make progress on the former is by truly energizing the latter.  We're at a crossroads for the project right now; one future path leads the way of many higher educational consortiums Ð apathy and decay.  The other path leads where a select few higher educational consortiums have gone - a vibrant and animated future.  Although it's clear the Sakai Project must have clear technical goals and strategies and mechanisms for building the code I'm convinced the harder part of great future is in building community and consensus and harnessing the vast intellectual capital that is housed in our member institutions.  That's the piece where I'd like to add value.</p>
