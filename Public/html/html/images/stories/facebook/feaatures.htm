Sakai provides an application framework and associated CMS tools and components that are designed to work together.&nbsp; These components are for course management, and, as an augmentation of the original CMS model, they also support research collaboration.</p><p>Using a web browser, users choose from Sakai's many tools to create a worksite that is suited for courses, projects, and/or research collaboration. For coursework, Sakai provides features to supplement and enhance teaching and learning. For projects and collaboration, Sakai has tools to help organize communication and collaborative work on campus and around the world. To use Sakai, no knowledge of HTML is necessary. Here are some examples of worksites made with Sakai: </p><ul><li>a worksite where an instructor or project director can make announcements and share resources, such as electronic documents or links to other websites..</li> <li>a worksite that serves as an online discussion board.</li><li>a course worksite where students can work on and submit assignments electronically.</li></ul><p><strong>Tools &amp; Features</strong></p><ul><li id="announcements"><strong>Announcements Tool</strong><br />Announcements are used to inform site participants of current items of interest. Announcements can have multiple attachments, including documents and URLs. It is possible to draft and save an announcement before sending it out to site participants or posting it on the worksite. Announcements appear in a list when you are in the Announcements Tool. They also appear on the home page of each course or project worksite. Worksite owners and instructors can choose to have an announcement automatically emailed to all of the site participants by using an optional &quot;notification&quot; setting.<br /><blockquote><strong>Examples of use: </strong><br />--Announcements can be useful for posting a notice about an importantchange in deadlines, meeting times, or meeting locations.</blockquote> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="assignments"> <strong>Assignments Tool</strong><br />For courses, the Sakai Assignments Tool allows instructors to create, distribute, collect, and grade online assignments. Assignments are private and student submissions are not visible to other users of the worksite. The Assignments Tool allows grading using letter grades, points, check marks, pass/fail or ungraded. Assignments can also be returned, with or without grades, for re-submission. This feature can be used to evaluate drafts of final projects or papers, or to allow students to correct and re-submit an assignment.<br /> <br />Instructors can download all submissions to an assignment to their computer at once. When instructors release grades for an assignment, students can access instructor comments along with their grade. <br /> </li><li id="chat"> <strong> Chat Room Tool</strong><br />The Chat Room Tool is for real-time, unstructured conversations with users who are signed on to the worksite at the same time as you are. The Chat Room Tool allows for more than one &quot;Chat Room,&quot; which an instructor or site owner can create for specific kinds of chats. The Chat Tool alerts users on the Chat page to the other participants who are also viewing that page. This way, users know who is available to talk in Chat. By default, Chat messages are saved and are visible to all users. <br /> <br /><blockquote> <strong>Examples of use:</strong><br /> --Instructors can easily create an "Online Office Hours" Chat room for student questions and answers. <br /> <br />--Dispersed collaboration groups can use Chat as a space to haveconversations across distances or catch up with conversations they mayhave missed.<br /> </blockquote> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="discussion"> <strong>Discussion Tool</strong><br />The Sakai Discussion Tool allows structured conversations that are organized in categories and topics. Worksite participants can post replies to a topic (a &quot;flat&quot; discussion) or to other replies (a &quot;threaded&quot; discussion). The worksite owner can also choose whether or not to allow site participants to post their own discussion topics. You can view Discussions in a row or column layout. &nbsp;<br /> <br /><blockquote><strong>Examples of use </strong><br />--Some classes use categories like &quot;Homework Questions&quot; and &quot;Exam Review&quot; to structure their Discussion feature. Others create categories for course concepts.<br> <br />--Many collaboration worksites allow any participant to start a discussion topic, which facilitates a more collegial discussion environment.<br /> </blockquote> </li> <br /><li id="dropbox"> <strong> Drop Box Tool</strong><br />The Drop Box Tool allows instructors and students to share documents in a private folder for each student. The Drop Box Tool works like the Resources Tool to allow you to upload and create different types of files, and upload many files at a time. The Drop Box also allows for nested folders (folders within folders).<br /> <br /><blockquote> <strong>Example of use</strong><br /> --Instructors and site owners can use the Drop Box Tool to provide private progress reports to each student.<br /> </blockquote> </li><li id="emailarchive"> <strong>Email Archive Tool</strong><br />Each Sakai worksite has an automatically generated worksite email address, which you can view in the Email Archive Tool. Email sent to the site email address is copied to all site participants and owners. All messages sent to your Sakai worksite's email address are stored in the Email Archive. Worksite owners can create an easy-to-remember alias for the worksite's email address.<br /> <br /><blockquote> <strong>Examples of use</strong><br />Sakai worksites for courses can make use of the Email Archive Tool to have an automatically updated course email group. As students drop or add the course, they will be dropped or added from the email group appropriately.<br /> <br />Users can choose to receive emails as they are sent, or via one daily email with all messages digested.<br /> </blockquote> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /> <br /><li id="help"><strong>Help Tool</strong><br />Sakai provides an online contextual Help Tool. By clicking the Help button while you have a tool open, you will see a window with information about that tool. The Help Tool also contains a list of links for browsing other help topics, and a search function.<br /> <br /> </li><li id="home"><strong>Home</strong><br />Home is a portal page available for every course and project worksite. Instructors and worksite owners can customize the home page to display synoptic views of the most current announcements, discussion board postings, or chat messages. The Home page of a worksite is also where a description of the worksite is presented.<br /> <br /> </li><li id="membership"> <strong>Membership Tool</strong><br />The Membership Tool is a tool in your My Workspace that allows you to join and unjoin sites. It provides a list of sites of which you are a member and a list of sites that have global access, and are therefore joinable.<br /> <br /> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="myworkspace"> <strong>My Workspace</strong><br />Sakai provides each user with his or her own individual online worksite which functions as a private workspace. Your workspace includes several features, including Resources, Schedule, Worksite Setup, Announcements, News, Web Content, Preferences, Help and Membership.<br /> <br /> </li><li id="news"> <strong>News Tool</strong><br />  The News Tool allows a Sakai worksite to display an RSS feed. RSS is a data format that allows users to view continuously updated content from another site. In addition to news, some websites use the RSS format for information that is updated often, such as blogs, events listings, or the revision history of a book. Worksite owners can customize their News feature by putting in a web address for any RSS feed.&nbsp;<br />    <br />   <blockquote> <strong>Example of use</strong><br /> Undergraduate Spanish classes have customized News to include news feeds from Spanish language Latin American publications.<br /> <br /></blockquote>  </li><li id="permissions"> <strong>Permissions and Roles</strong><br />When you create a course or project worksite, you choose which tools (e.g., discussion, schedule, resources, etc.) you want the worksite to have. For each of these tools, you can set permissions that allow or prevent users from seeing or performing certain tasks depending on a user's &quot;role.&quot; In Sakai, the various roles are given default permissions, but worksite owners can change these as desired for their site<br /> <br />&quot;Permissions&quot; is not a button in the menubar -- it is accessed via a button that appears when you open a tool in a project or course worksite. To view the default permission settings for a tool, click the Permissions button from the top menu bar in the tool's first page. <br /> <br /> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="preferences"> <strong>Preferences</strong><br />The Preferences Tools allows users to choose options relating to receiving emails to the site, and email notifications of new announcements and resources. Some examples of preferences include blocking low-priority notifications, receiving notifications when they are sent, and receiving a daily digest of notifications all at one time.<br><br></li><li id="samigo"> <strong>Quiz &amp; Test/Samigo Tool</strong><br />    The Quiz and Test Tool allows instructors and site owners to administer online surveys, quizzes, and exams. Students can answer a series of multiple choice, multiple answer, true/false, short answer, matching, or fill in the blank questions. The Quiz and Test Tool provides a variety of options such as randomizing answers, importing questions, creating a question pool, and organizing the assessment into sections. It allows for file upload and audio recording as types of question types. The Quiz and Test Tool features a question bank where instructors can store questions for later reuse.<br />     <br /> </li><li id="resources"> <strong>Resources Tool</strong><br />Resources is the most widely used tool in classes and collaborations. In Resources, you can make many kinds of material available online. There are three main types: documents (word processing documents, spreadsheets, slide presentations, plain text, etc.); links to other websites; and documents that are created and displayed right on the Sakai page. Users can post up to 10 resources at a time, post items outside of folders, create folders in folders, and create html documents in Sakai. Using the Permissions feature, worksite owners can control which types of users can post, delete, and read documents in specific folders.  <blockquote> <strong>Examples of use</strong> <br /> Many classes post weekly readings in Resources. Their resources can include links to websites as well as other kinds of documents, like Adobe PDF files. Some also post presentations or slides used in lectures.<br /> <br />By adjusting the Resource Permissions, a large collaboration site can use one folder in Resources as a space to archive important documents, and allow only certain site participants to modify those documents. </blockquote> <br /> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="schedule"> <strong>Schedule Tool</strong><br />Schedule allows instructors or worksite organizers to post items in calendar format. The calendar has day, week, month, year, and a flat list view. Any Schedule item can have multiple attachments. All Schedules on worksites you have access to are merged in your My Workspace Schedule. In a worksite, you can also selectively merge Schedules from other worksites you have access to using the Merge feature. You can print an Adobe PDF file of any view of a Schedule by clicking the &quot;Print PDF&quot; button while in the desired view.<br /> <br /> <blockquote><strong>Examples of use</strong><br /> Many instructors use the Schedule to post readings for each class, on the day they are due to be read.<br /> <br /> Research, group, and departmental project members often use the Schedule to post group deadlines.<br /></blockquote> </li><li id="siteinfo"> <strong>Site Info Tool</strong> <br />The Site Info Tool provides information about a worksite that you own. You can access Site Info while you are in the worksite. In addition to providing information such as the participant list, Site Info allows you to make changes to the information about the worksite, the tools, and access to the site. Using the Site Info Tool, you can also publish the worksite, duplicate the site, and import material from other sites that you own to include in your site. <br /> <br /> </li><li id="syllabus"> <strong>Syllabus Tool</strong><br />  The syllabus is the official outline for your course. As an instructor, if you or your department has prepared an online syllabus already, you can direct the Syllabus Tool to link to it. Otherwise, you can enter material directly in your Syllabus tool. As you create a syllabus, you can designate that it be viewable by the general public or just to members of your course. <br />  <br />  Some features of a traditional syllabus are divided between the Syllabus and Schedule Tools. Some instructors use the Syllabus area to display the department's official online syllabus, and use the Schedule as a detailed resource for students. You have the option to format your syllabus content in HTML instead of plain text.<br />  <br /></li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="synoptic"> <strong>Synoptic Tools</strong><br />  On the homepage of each worksite, synoptic tools display recent announcements, recent discussion items, and recent chat messages. These synoptic tools are configurable by the site owner as to time period and number of items to display. Synoptic tools give a quick look of recent site activity when the user first visits the site.<br />  <br />  <blockquote><strong>Examples of use</strong><br />Instructors use the announcement tool to notify Students of meeting time/location changes. They set the Synoptic Announcement tool to show the most recent 3 messages within a 1 week period to give students a quick look at announcements relevant to the upcoming week<br /><br /></blockquote></li><li><strong>Web Content Tool</strong><br />The Web Content tool allows worksite owners to choose a website to display within the Sakai frame. The Web Content button in the left-hand menu is customizable so you can create a label for the button that matches the website you've chosen to display.<br /> <br /> <blockquote><strong>Examples of use</strong><br />Instructors who want to provide many links to websites for their students may list them in Resources, but choose the most important for the Web Content feature. <br /> <br />Departments, collaborations, or other groups may choose to use Web Content to provide a prominent link to their public website within their Sakai worksite.<br /> <br /></blockquote> </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /><li id="webdav"> <strong>WebDAV Tool</strong><br />In Sakai, you can copy a file from your local system to your My Workspace or class resources using the New<strong></strong>button in the Resources Tool. If you want to copy an entire folder of files all at once, software called WebDAV can be used. <br><br>WebDAV is a technology which allows network file systems. Using WebDAV, you can attach to a Sakai worksite Resources folder such that it appears to be a local folder on your desktop. Once you have setup WebDAV to a particular worksite&rsquo;s Resources, you can drag and drop files and folders to and from your desktop and the Sakai worksite&rsquo;s Resources. This provides an easy way to upload/download multiple files at once.<br /> <br /> </li><li id="worksiteinfo"> <strong>Worksite Information Tool</strong><br />On the homepage of each course worksite, the Worksite Information Tool can be used to display descriptive information about the worksite. The information can be simple unformatted text, html formatted, or can point to a website of information.<br /> <br> <blockquote><strong>Examples of use</strong><br />Instructors provide an overview of the specifics of their course for the term by pointing to a webpage on the department server.<br><br>A project site owner includes a description of the project goal and collaboration &lsquo;rules&rsquo; that participants of the site should adhere to when using the site.<br /> </blockquote></li><li id="worksiteSetup"> <strong>Worksite Setup Tool </strong><br />The Worksite Setup Tool is used to create project and course websites. It is a series of forms in steps that guide users through the process.<br /> <br />The Worksite Setup Tool also provides a list of your worksites. When revising a worksite, you can make changes to the information about a worksite, add/remove tools, and change access rights. . Using the Worksite Setup Tool, you can also publish the worksite, duplicate the worksite, and import material from other worksites that you own. <br /> <br />&nbsp; </li><br /><a href="#top">back to top </a><br /><br /> </ul> </div></body></html>
