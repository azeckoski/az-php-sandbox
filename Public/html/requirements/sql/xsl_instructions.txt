To transform an XML file created by JIRA's export, you need to know the following:

1) JIRA's XML export only exports the first 25 records by default.
   You'll need to edit the URL behind the "XML" link and change the
   maxTemp param to a number greater than or equal to the number of
   issues being exported.

2) JIRA's XML export often generates files that aren't complete.  In
   fact, you may see errors attempting to open the URL.  You'll have
   to view the source, save the source to a file, edit the file, and
   complete the closing </rss> tag to get a usable file.

3) You need an XSLT processor to transform the XML into SQL (duh!).  I
   used xsltproc under cygwin.   The syntax there was something like:

   xsltproc -o sakai_requirements_data_20060223.sql jira2sql.xsl sakai_requirements_data20060223.xml


Feel free to modify the XSL as needed, just be kind and give me a
little credit... :)
