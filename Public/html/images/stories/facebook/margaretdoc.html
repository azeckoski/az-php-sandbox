This fall has seen an increasing number of campus production and pilot implementations of Sakai and a number of new contributions, tools and partnerships.&nbsp; In one of these new partnerships, the OSP community is joining the Sakai community at this conference, strengthening both of our efforts to bring innovative tools and methods to education, research and the global learning community. </font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Geneva">Come to Austin ready to share, learn, make connections and collaborate, and of course to have some fun! </font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Geneva">The Sakai conference program is being designed to strengthen the growing Sakai community by bringing the entire community together to share their Sakai vision, experiences, and implementations.&nbsp; Accordingly, there are sessions that will be devoted to the future of the codebase, Sakai governance and the integration of other community source projects such as OSP. There will also be new tracks that focus on teaching and learning, on eResearch, and on other related projects, such as OCW, OKI, IMS, and much more.&nbsp; And you can create a BOF on the topic of most importance to you. </font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Geneva">Sakai conferences have become major biannual events with attendance increasing significantly with each conference. We therefore expect a very large gathering in Austin and we have planned facilities accordingly.&nbsp; Register early to guarantee a place. </font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Geneva">The Conference Program Committee is preparing to put up a call for session proposals and a conference registration site by the end of this week.&nbsp; See the Events section of this newsletter for hotel information. </font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Geneva">OSP is the Open Source Portfolio, which runs within Sakai technology. OSPI has met separately at conferences in the summer of 2004 and 2005 but for this and future conferences will combine communities with Sakai. The Open Source Portfolio Initiative also has Mellon funding, and a number of universities and the rSmart group supporting it. OSPI will function through the newly-forming Sakai Foundation. </font></p>  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Geneva">We have been in communication with our hotel in Austin regarding the impact of New Orleans conference rescheduling and have been reassured we are still on track for December 7-9 in Austin. </font></p></div></body></html>
